That being said, I have my favorites that are in the regular rotation. For the most part, I own FLG’s, but over the years I have acquired a few FJB’s because I wanted that particular texture.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nI purchased Carnal about a year ago, and I’ve been very impressed with this sleeve. Unfortunately, you cannot buy FJB sleeves without the case. Hopefully Fleshlight will make FJB’s available as a sleeve only option, but for now only the Ice edition sleeves are available sleeve only. Carnal came with a light blue case in a retail box.<br/>\nCarnal is brown skin toned sleeve that is comparable, on the outside, to most butt sleeves, boy or girl. That being said, to this day Carnal is one of the best sleeves I own. It’s on the same level as Kumzumi, Waifu, Thunder, or any other highly rated sleeves that I own. What makes it a top tier sleeve is the design of the interior texture. For whatever reason, how it looks, is how it actually feels. I own quite a few sleeves and some I just can’t differentiate between the textures in different chambers or sometimes even notice textures at all. This is where Carnal stands out from the crowd. <br/>\nUpon entering Carnal, it’s apparent that there is a firmness, and this soft yet firm quality extends through the entire sleeve. It’s nice and snug at the entry, followed by the first chamber that has three slightly angled mounds with three beads on each, and the exact same pattern follows, but slightly rotated from the first set of mounds. The next chamber has two rings surrounded by nubs at the base, and you really feel the rings. Finally, the third chamber is made up of strips that are slightly angled and reverse the angle at the center for a smooth gliding experience. I was pleasantly surprised that the final chamber perfectly complemented the intensity of the first two chambers. It helps if you keep your lube ”wet” due to the intensity, but doesn’t really require much more lube than other sleeves.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>I hope that those who are interested find my personal experience helpful. I highly recommend Carnal for anyone who prefers intense sleeves. Also, there’s a lot going on in the front half of the sleeve if that is something you look for. Good luck and good flights.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"November 18th, 2023",reviewer_url:"/en/u/flesh_cracker",reviewer:"Flesh_cracker",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Electric",girl:"Joey Mills",url:"/en/texture/electric",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/electric.jpg",scores:[4.7,4.47,4.11,4,3.9,2.7,2.26,2.18,4.08,2.94,3.45,3.63,3.06,4.58],description:"The tight young twink ass you’ve longed for is finally yours!

Thanks for reading my review. To start I’m 6X4.5 and I use Fleshlight’s water based lube. This is an intense sleeve, upon entry it is mildly tight, the wave pattern is pretty noticeable but with the dots on top of it really add to the sleeve, you can definitely feel the dots or (balls) on the head of your member. I got extremely hard within a few minutes, I have even entered semi and I had no problem getting “all the way there.” Cleanup is pretty straightforward, the sleeve when dry has a matte finish, and I enjoy that it has more cheek than my other FJB. Drying time is a little bit longer.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Overall this is a great sleeve if you are looking for a unique intense texture. Or if you are a fan of Joey. I think the matte finish that is has alone is something to look for. Although be aware that on first use it has a grinding sensation, but I didn’t experience that the 3rd or 4th time.

I first noticed the great oriface detail that this sleeve was given - this is one of the better looking Fleshjacks that I have owned.. The hole has lots or realistic wrinkles and is very pleasing to look at. The cheeks are also about average size but are shaped in a way that makes it relatively easy to enter so long as you are mostly erect. The initial penetration sensation is tight, but not overbearingly so. Throughout it's entire length, the sleeve stays relatively snug as you pass through. The best way to describe the texture itself is a hybrid between ribs and large nubs, which is unique. The nubs are positioned in a triangular pattern that massages you from all angles, so it can be quite intense with the cap tightened. Rugged reminds me of the nubs on Brent Corrigan's Bliss, but in a less tight and intense way. Overall I feel like this is a great reliable sleeve which is versatile enough to have a quick or long session. If you know you enjoy bumps in a texture, Rugged is sure to please!\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Overall, a great versatile sleeve with a consistent texture that is reliable and predictable.

The skin tone is really nice on this one, just like Esperanza and it feels super smooth.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you first slide into this one, you can feel it grips you immediately. And the lips really grip you the whole time, like Madison Ivy's 'Beyond' does.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 1st texture is a stimulating raised spiral style texture, reminds me a little of Lvl Up's 1st texture, but Amante feels more intense to me (in a good way).<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing from 1st to 2nd chamber you feel a sudden tightening and a pop, as your head pushes through, similar to a Lotus node effect. This 2nd chamber has 3 sections with a pattern that i can only describe like a radioactive symbol, if that makes sense. And the tips of these shapes that contact you are not rounded off, so the stimulation is very good here.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you feel that same tightening and pop effect i mentioned before, as you enter chamber 3. Now here is my favourite part of Amante. This section gets tighter and the whole chamber is full of these raised figure of 8 shapes, and i do mean raised. There is nothing at all subtle here! When you're well lubed, these will grab you with suction, almost like the round suckers on an octopus' tentacles. There is some suction noise when you're hitting that back section, but it's not excessive.. The good type of sexy noise and totally adds to the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were a fan of the waffle texture in Cream, then i can tell you right now Amante's 3rd chamber takes that type of stimulation to a whole new level. The head stimulation is very intense. Great news for me, as Cream was previously my #1. I have a feeling Amante has now knocked it off my #1 spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far the orgasms with Amante have been, for me personally, the most intense i ever had with a FL. I did everything i could to edge for a while, it was NOT easy. When i reached orgasm, i could barely move during, but oh boy was it incredibly pleasurable... Legs shaking and eyes rolling in the head.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>All in all, i can't recommend this one highly enough for those who want a great sleeve with intense stimulation, strong suction effect and one that really stimulates the head well. If you are oversensitive or struggle with head stimulation, it might not be ideal for you. Also shorter fellas will still love this sleeve as the 1st and 2nd chambers feel exceptionally good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI rate Amante a 5/5 for me, this is absolutely a must have in any collection!</p>\n</div>",review_time:"March 26th, 2023",reviewer_url:"/en/u/heman690",reviewer:"HeMan690",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery2_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery4_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery6_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery7_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery8_grande.jpg?v=1679275777"]},{name:"Majestic",girl:"Allen King",url:"/en/texture/majestic",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/majestic.jpg",scores:[3.91,4.06,4.49,4.34,3.88,3.6,3.02,3.36,4.51,3.99,3.5,3.75,2.96,4.41],description:"",review:'<div class="text">\n<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br/>I use my sleeves for at least a month before writing reviews.

My favorite part is the oriface - the hole is very tight and has a detailed, puckered look which somewhat protrudes forward out of the sleeve - a unique detail compared to other sleeves I own. The cheeks are about average depth compared to other sleeves I have used, but there seems to be more material around the opening versus many of the anal sleeves which creates an additional feeling of tightness wrapping around you. The initial penetration sensation is quite tight and has a virgin like feel to it. Coupled with a hole that really grabs you makes this my favorite visually pleasing sleeve during use. Upon entry, the initial tightness eases slightly in the first chamber, which includes a great node with swirls to massage the head. The sleeve then gets progressively tighter afterwards. There is definitely a grindy feeling, although it is difficult to discern the different sections of the sleeve outside of the swirl node towards the middle. The first 3-4 inches is the sweet spot for myself, as I’ve found the tightness further down the sleeve can be too intense at times. The biggest downside of this sleeve is that due to the exceptionally tight opening and slightly protruding hole, its difficult to get inside unless you are completely hard, and I find myself slipping out if I’m not paying attention which can be frustrating at times.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>This would be a great addition for someone who is about average or even below average size to have a stimulating experience. Those who are larger may find this sleeve may become too tight and may want to consider something a bit more relaxed. I would advise using plenty of lube with this sleeve for the best experience. Cleaning is about average and the dry time is on the longer side due to the narrow texture. Majestic is one of my top favorites and would recommend picking it up if it interests you.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"June 6th, 2022",reviewer_url:"/en/u/shred0502",reviewer:"shred0502",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Too Good To Be Tru",girl:"Tru Kait",url:"/en/texture/too-good-to-be-tru",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/too-good-to-be-tru.jpg",scores:[3.61,3.19,4.56,4.61,3.67,3.76,1.68,3.46,3.96,3.12,3.96,3.86,3.79,4.28],description:"A sensation so extraordinary, it's Too Good To Be Tru.

The entrance is nice and tight as you might expect with anal sleeves in general and it has pretty good suction if you're into that (not really my thing so I dont have much to say about it). Comparing it to my other anal sleeves, I will say that I don't think it does anything particularly unique. The tight entrance is pretty common among anal sleeves. The interior texture is also tight, but its pretty smooth. I would say that this sleeve is very similar to Ahegao. Ahegao is maybe a little more intense because the interior isnt as smooth as the texture on TGTBT is. The exterior cheeks are also very middle of the road as far as size and shape. All in all, I don't think this is a bad sleeve by any means. Its hits good marks on all the right places for a tight, semi-realistic anal experience.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>TGTBT is a good, medium intensity anal sleeve that maintains its snugness throughout the interior. In many ways, I would describe it almost like an anal sleeve reduced down to its base parts. Tight entry, snug interior, medium intesity texture, good suction, etc. Other anal sleeves will branch out on those features while maintaining the others. Tight chicks is really smooth but kicks the tight entrance into high gear. Ahegao is very similar to this sleeve, but with a more intense interior. Shameless has a tight entrance with a very stimulating interior, etc. I would recommend this if you're looking to try out anal sleeves, and branch out to others using this as a baseline.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 17th, 2023",reviewer_url:"/en/u/unknown22",reviewer:"Unknown22",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/TruKait-Webassets-Gallery6_grande.jpg?v=1697470697","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/TruKait-Webassets-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1697470697","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/TruKait-Webassets-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1697470697","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/TruKait-Webassets-Gallery2_grande.jpg?v=1697470697","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/TruKait-Webassets-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1697470697"]},{name:"Boom",girl:"Blake Blossom",url:"/en/texture/boom",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/boom.jpg",scores:[4.04,4.22,4.24,4.13,4.34,3.5,2.99,3.09,4.58,3.73,3.8,3.97,3.97,4.37],description:"BOOM is right!

Now onto the review!</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nThunder, and Megan Rain in general, seem to have fallen victim to being released just before the Autumn Falls hype train, which seemed to make cream the only sleeve talked about for some time. It’s a shame because Thunder is a well designed sleeve with great intensity and constant stimulation. At a glance, the sleeve looks pretty consistent, but there are subtle changes in the size and shape of the potruding nubs that happen roughly every 1/3 of the sleeve. These variations make for subtle changes in the amount of intensity but all keep a consistent level of high stimulation, and a more organic transition that just allows the sleeve to flow together without any interruption. On the tighter side but not in the same realm as some of the tightest sleeves Fleshlight offers, which puts it in an ideal ratio of tightness to intensity. The individual nub can be felt as you thrust over them as of they’re teasing your nerve endings themselves with each one brushing over you. You can feel yourself gliding across these nubs, allowing the more intense initial ones to create an excellent tingling massage sensation on the shaft, while the less pronounced, softened nubs of the middle chamber can focus on the more sensitive head to do the same without being too much stimuli. As with most sleeves, this one works better when towing the line with just enough lube, while too much can start to drown out the resistance of the individual nubs and make the sensation feel much duller.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>An incredible sleeve that shouldn’t be glossed over when looking for a top anal texture.

We have an air cleaner and fans running in the bedroom (white noise), so I would not notice any noise from the sleeve. I use the run water thru the sleeve method of cleaning and then set them on the bookshelf for drying.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nI recently got Beyond in my Black Friday Purchase of 2019. I added this sleeve to my wish list based on other reviews here that talked about the \"Lips that gripped\". I thought that I knew what they meant by that phrase as far as I felt the lips gripping me when I fully inserted. But it wasn't until today when I hit that sweet spot with the lube that I really caught on to what they meant by \"Lips that Grip\" When I was pulling out of the sleeve, the lips were gripping me and tugging on my shaft as I withdrew. I had not experienced this in my previous uses of Beyond because of too much lube. I was also able to feel much more of the texture as well that I was missing with too much lube.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo on to the review.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrifice: This is one of those sleeves that has protruding labia on it. The lips appear to be somewhat delicate, and they curve around the top of the vaginal opening. I find that this is good for teasing the head of your penis with the lips if that is what you like. In addition, because of this curvature, they can also grip your shaft when your pulling out if you hit that sweet spot on the lube. If you are over lubed, they still grip the base of your shaft when your are fully inserted. You want to have some lube on the lips, or you risk tearing them and ruining that great feature to this sleeve.<br/>\n<br/>\nPenetration: This sleeve actually had two penetration points for me. First entering between the protruding lips, then penetration into the vaginal opening itself. With the lips curling around the head of your penis, this first penetration is a great feeling that I find myself playing with before moving on to penetration of the vaginal opening . If I start out semi-flacid and play with the lips, I eventually get stiff enough to make that vaginal penetration that reminds me of my wife opening up and accepting the girth of my penis. I've done a similar foreplay of playing with the lips/clitoris when having sex with the wife in the past<br/>\n<br/>\nTightness: This felt like a medium tightness sleeve to me with my girth. Not too tight, and not too loose. I really didn't have any problems with moving inside the sleeve. It was a pleasant hugging feeling that combined with the suction seemed just about right. I can only expect that this will loosen up just a bit with time like my other sleeves have.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuction: I was getting great suction on the sleeve this afternoon. Combined with the lips gripping my shaft, it was a great experience that I felt I needed to write about without delaying longer on this review.<br/>\n<br/>\nRealism: Due to the foreplay with the lips, and the smoothness combined with the suction as I stroked in and out of the sleeve. (I had the top closed today) I find this to be a very realistic sleeve to me. I'm still breaking in the sleeve so I am not noticing much of the internal texture in the sleeve yet. This may change my opinion on the realism with the sleeve when it gets more broken in and I can feel more of the texture.<br/>\n<br/>\nVariation: I'm not yet noticing much of any variation in the sleeve. I expect that with age, the section from 1.5\" to 2.5\" will stand out more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmoothness: Beyond is still a very smooth sleeve to me. I expect this to change with age as I feel more of the sleeve texture.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm rating: This is one of those sleeves that for me was good right out of the box without any need for break in. I don't recall how long I took with the sleeve each time, but I have not had a bad experience with it yet. Because of the smoothness and mildness of the sleeve texture right now, I am able to take it slower for a longer edging session.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>This is a sleeve that I am very happy with considering my short length (4.0) and only reaching half way into the sleeve. If you like to play with the labia, then its a no brainer on getting this sleeve. The lips are why I bought this sleeve. I see Beyond as being one of my favorite sleeves long term.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your past high intensity sleeves and looking for something else, then I strongly recommend that you add Beyond to your collection. I'd put Beyond up there with Destroya as a must have for any collection.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 30th, 2019",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mike_in_co",reviewer:"Mike_in_CO",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Madison-Gallery_0000_Madison_Ivy_Gold_H4A2652_grande.jpg?v=1556638902","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Madison-Gallery_0001_Madison_Ivy_Rug_H4A2375_grande.jpg?v=1556638902","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Madison-Gallery_0004_Madison_Ivy_Car_H4A1967_grande.jpg?v=1556638902","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Madison-Gallery_0005_Madison_Ivy_Bed_H4A2793_grande.jpg?v=1556638902","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Madison-Gallery_0002_Madison_Ivy_Pool_H4A1859_grande.jpg?v=1556638902","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Madison-Gallery_0003_Madison_Ivy_Gold_DSC1897_grande.jpg?v=1556638902"]},{name:"Waifu",girl:"Violet Myers",url:"/en/texture/waifu",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/waifu.jpg",scores:[3.94,4.13,3.95,3.57,3.78,3.38,3.82,3.52,4.31,3.67,3.62,3.63,3.54,4.29],description:"Violet Myers is your favorite anime fantasy girl come to life.

Most of my reviews reference how that review FLight was accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to the review for the: Violet Myers Waifu!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow I got it: I bought this in September 2022 upon the release of Violet Myers as a FLG. I also got Ahegao as well, but that's another review for another time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAesthetics: WOW! The Waifu includes a replica of Violet Myers' vulva, and it is quite the sight to behold and even play with. Admittedly, the first time I opened up the Waifu, I must have played with the \"lips\" for a considerable period of time. <br/>\n<br/>\nLube: As mentioned in the intro, I use Gun Oil H2O, which is a water-based lubricant. DO NOT USE the original silicone variant of lube or any silicone or oil lube. Because there is a bumpy texture around the middle that does get a little snug, you might need a little more lube, but when in doubt, use more. <br/>\n<br/>\nNoise: If you unscrew the cap slightly, the Waifu does emit some noise, but unless you are FLying with your room open or someone actually in the room, it's probably not audible outside the room. <br/>\n<br/>\nPenetration: Pushing myself inside the Waifu and penetrating the sleeve was exquisite. Entering, you have a period of what can best be described as a bunch of screwdriver/tool bits that have been hacked in half and then casted in FL sleeve material, and this feels good. But it gets better: about halfway into the sleeve, you have a rather narrow section of what can best be described as a bunch of tiny STU bumps compressed together to form a snug \"portal\" to the final parts of the sleeve. Finally, there appears to be a part of the sleeve that looks like an \"accelerator chamber\" of sorts, encouraging you to try to go fully inside as much as possible. My length did let me get to a small portion of this area, but unless you are very well endowed in length, you probably will just get to sample this area. When I pulled back outwards, everything felt just as great, especially that narrow bumpy region, which works wonders on one's glans. It felt so good, I definitely wanted to thrust back inwards again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: Some sleeves are rather mild, and some are very intense. The Waifu, for me, starts off at a moderate level of intensity, but not for long. After a few thrusts, the sleeve begins to assert itself upon me and my member. I immediately feel a compulsion to thrust/stroke faster. And although I try to resist and want to see how long I can go, eventually I give in. The intensity ratchets up with each thrust and it's not long at all before I realize what the sleeve is designed for. In the real world, Violet Myers knows what she wants and gets what she wants, and the Waifu is the very embodiment of that mentality. The Waifu wants you to cum. The intensity reaches a furious peak. In just a few minutes, I can feel my release building. I want to, and I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm: With a FL, there are three orgasms that tend to come about (pun intended). One is a gentle buildup that leads to a nice orgasm. Another is one that causes you to cum without warning. The last is a \"when you blow, you know.\" The Waifu is definitely the third type of sleeve. While you can go a little while with this sleeve, you will blow, and you will know. Even if the FLight only lasts a few minutes, I have felt every orgasm be complete and satisfying, and I'm already thinking about the next FLight with the Waifu.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleanup: A good steady stream of warm/hot water will easily remove all of the lube and aftermath, but do take some time, and make sure you clear that snug area of bumps of any byproduct. Consider running the stream of water through both ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you have the Fleshlight AIR, drying is a breeze. Dry the outer sleeve and the case, put the sleeve back in the case, with neither lid on and screw in the FL to the AIR and turn the AIR on. Given the varied textures of the Waifu, I'd go for three presses of the on button (60 minutes) to ensure your sleeve is totally dry. Unscrew from AIR, recap the FL and it's ready to go again. If you don't have a AIR, Paper Towels (and quality paper towels, not store brand economy towels) are your next best friend. Run them through the canal a few times (be careful not to tear them). Then leave out in open air to dry (if you need to conceal the sleeve, stick in a old (but clean) t-shirt loosely to allow air to vent.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Although not my top most rated sleeve (Cream I believe still holds my top rating as of this review), this is a really good sleeve. Even if you are pressed for time and can just manage a quick flight, the Waifu will get you there (and you won't feel cheated). The Waifu may or may not be a top 3 buy, but I can see it as a strong top 5 sleeve for many and a top 10 for most.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"September 24th, 2022",reviewer_url:"/en/u/revtwentyseven",reviewer:"revtwentyseven",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_91bdbff2-1b02-4cd7-95eb-5ecf69a6cb19_grande.jpg?v=1669994385","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_f34f3dad-a5f4-4969-b17c-2eab2d1bbbd7_grande.jpg?v=1669994385","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_0b192cf1-b638-4e96-a83c-1eaf009198f5_grande.jpg?v=1669994385","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_9df3ca11-0ca9-43db-9dc5-1da0ef33c7fc_grande.jpg?v=1669994385","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_875ae824-7211-4be2-a41c-84370f6bc268_grande.jpg?v=1669994385","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_3aff6e19-9930-40a6-a0fa-4d8fa38af493_grande.jpg?v=1669994385","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery7_037cf555-6ab6-4d4b-bcb6-e6d661030255_grande.jpg?v=1669994385","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery8_2f438109-883f-4d3a-aa41-55319f09631d_grande.jpg?v=1669994385"]},{name:"Sonic Boom",girl:"Boomer Banks",url:"/en/texture/sonic-boom",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/sonic-boom.jpg",scores:[3.31,3.67,3.41,2.57,3.17,3.83,3.56,3.44,4.22,3.34,3.24,3.59,3.3,4.29],description:"Brace yourself!

I certainly like some orifices (vaginal &amp; anal) better than others, but ultimately I don’t care enough to not buy a texture I really want to experience. I’m apparently more of a spirals and nubs guy as opposed to a ridges/ribs guy. I use my FLs for hours-long edge sessions, either in hand or propped up. I often enjoy a lot of head-play in the first couple of inches of the FL, controlling orgasm, alternating with inserting the whole way for a few slow strokes. Rinse and repeat. I use Swiss-Army h2o lube and an eye-dropper with water to rewet when necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought Boomer Banks Sonic Boom in 2020. Of the 3 FJ sleeves I got at that time, it has become my favourite<br/>\n<br/>\nI was originally really disappointed with this one. It’s the loosest of the 3, it has the widest opening such that I can enter it with a semi, and is the most subtle. First few times I used it I couldn’t feel much of anything, but over time as I’ve recovered sensitivity, this has totally changed for me and it’s become my go-to. I really like the wider opening because it means I can just kinda lose myself in the sensations and not be interrupted thinking about getting back in if I pop out (ie. your aim doesn’t have to be precise). It also means you can feel the variations really well. The first pronounced swirl texture (1-3”) is absolutely amazing for how I use it. It’s soft and subtle, but gives a very “wrapped” feeling, especially when I dial the suction and lube right, and I can get lost here for hours. The next section (3-5”) narrows a bit, and feels similar, but not as pronounced. I can feel the transition to the section at 5-6”, and then that’s as far as I get. I’ve tried using the sleeve from the other end, but I’m not a fan of ribs, so it doesn’t do much for me. Overall it’s low intensity for me, and I can finish in the sleeve no problem. Cleaning isn’t difficult as you can reach the most pronounced texture easily with your fingers. Drying time is low.<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>If you like spirals, you like milder textures, and/or you like an orgasm that builds slowly, then this might be a sleeve you want to seriously consider.

I am 7 1/4\" long and have a 6 1/2\" girth, cut and frenelectomized, so I'm relatively insensitive. I use Tenga Lube Real and ALWAYS begin by warming the sleeve with the fleshlight warmer (great product btw), but time to review my favorite fleshlight to date Dominika's Butterfly!<br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity- More isn't always better! I view intensity as how quickly one can get from point a to point b if you know what I mean. Whilst this sleeve isn't exactly the most intense, it does pack a punch! If you go to town on this sleeve you can be there at any time you want, but at the same time, IT IS WHEN YOU WANT! I can't stress enough just how absolutely fantastic that is. If your not close enough or want a quicky, a good pounding and you're there no questions asked! If you want to take it slow and edge for a good long while, no sweat, this sleeve has you there too. This sleeve is gosh darn MAGIC! Between the large open (not as loose as the picture lets on) and the tight bumped constriction, you always seem to have what you want when you want it. The way everything blends together is just WOW! That spiked sphere at the 5\" - 6\" mark is so nice on the head. I could rave for hours about this thing. You may want to be 6\"+ to get the full experience, but in the best way imaginable 3.5/5 <br/>\n<br/>\nStimulation- This is where this sleeve makes its mark. It feels \"meaty\" and \"rich.\" Honestly this thing is just incredible. The closest comparison that I own is Elsa Jeans Tasty, a sleeve I believe should be a part of any collection. If you like Tasty, you'll love this. It hits you perfectly without being \"numbing\" or irritating! 4/5<br/>\n<br/>\nPenetration- So good it can make a grown man cry. I know \"lips\" aren't every ones aesthetic ideal, but I really encourage you to put that aside and just let how this sleeves mold feels shatter your preconceptions. Seriously it's that good. The way those lips feel as you penetrate this sleeve is unreal. Even just grinding your member on the entrance is enough to have a great time. Just purchase, just experience. 5/5<br/>\n<br/>\nTightness- So, peeks and valleys. It's got looser and tighter sections. A deep thrust and your wrapped in a wonderful bumpy constriction that's mind blowing. A shallow stroke and you're in pure bliss at the gentle stimulating texture of a diagonal bars that allow you to feel every inch. The contrast is miraculous. If you're afraid this sleeve will be too loose, it's not. It CAN be gentle. If you need TIGHT!!!! throughout a sleeve to get there or are below 5\" in length, maybe this isn't the best. Other than that, buy it 3/5<br/>\n<br/>\nRealism- If you want to feel freaky with a \"lippy\" girl. Ya, you'll get that experience. Pure wonder 4/5<br/>\n<br/>\nSmoothness- This might be tough to contextualize, but it's not that it's \"rough,\" you can just feel everything clearly and feel each bit of resistance. You know you penetrate that tight section at 3 inches and that's good! This sleeve should be fine for all but the most sensitive of users 3.5/5<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm Rating- Sigh. Soul sucking. Orgasm with a quicky, top notch. Orgasm if you take your time, mystical. No matter what point, what depth, or how fast, this sleeve delivers the best orgasms I may have ever had 5/5\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Dominika's Butterfly texture is really the best fleshlight I personally have ever owned. It may not have the best lube use, if that is that important to you, still buy it. I can not imagine what more I could ask of a sex toy. <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall Satisfaction- 5/5</p>\n</div>",review_time:"January 5th, 2022",reviewer_url:"/en/u/usedandexperienced",reviewer:"UsedAndExperienced",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Dominika-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1600267412","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Dominika-Gallery4_grande.jpg?v=1600267412","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Dominika-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1600267412","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Dominika-Gallery6_grande.jpg?v=1600267412","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Dominika-Gallery7_grande.jpg?v=1600267412","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Dominika-Gallery8_grande.jpg?v=1600267412"]},{name:"Tasty",girl:"Elsa Jean",url:"/en/texture/tasty",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/tasty.jpg",scores:[3.78,4.01,3.94,3.89,3.82,3.52,3.42,3.61,4.2,3.49,3.59,3.9,3.6,4.27],description:"Stick your shaft into the tight and cleverly designed Elsa Jean Treat.

While they aren't my first Fleshlights, they are the first ones I've had in about 10 years as my last one got tossed out when I got a new girlfriend sometime in 2011; too long ago to remember what it even was or how it felt, so for all intents and purposes I'm a newbie. For point of reference I'm 6.5\" x 5.75\".<br/>\nI purchased Cupcake because I love Kenzie's cute little ass and the texture looked good on the website so despite the fact that there were obviously no reviews on the new release I just decided to go for it. I've taken it on about 10-12 test flights so far, with a few orgies between Megan and Kenzie just for comparison's sake. <br/>\nThis sleeve is fantastic. The initial penetration is quite tight, (The first time I could barely get my cock in there) but as I'm breaking it in it has slightly loosened a bit. Warming it up in warm water for 5 minutes prior definitely helps. The initial texture in the first 4 inches isn't as stimulating as Thunder, but that's a good thing, as it definitely allows for more control when edging. The thing that really makes this sleeve great are the tight ridges after 4.5\"; really makes you want to go balls deep in this sleeve and just kind of work it at that depth.<br/>\nI only own two sleeves, but Cupcake is definitely my favorite so far, with Thunder a close second. That being said, I don't think Cupcake would be as good as Thunder for guys 5\" or under since they wouldn't get to the secondary tight ridges past 4.5\". As far as resembling actual anal sex, apart from the tight initial penetration it isn't really close, but absolutely great nonetheless.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>My new favorite sleeve with Megan Rain's Thunder a very close second.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 23rd, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/backdoorman38",reviewer:"backdoorman38",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_8121a860-73af-4ed9-9a91-777e5e996a81_grande.jpg?v=1637723779","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_1f993857-f385-4690-9f0b-1b119855f1e3_grande.jpg?v=1637723779","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_75f61ee2-351f-416d-aea1-23cfd16c33c7_grande.jpg?v=1637723779","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_14459405-6f79-4c34-9612-5b6db1602640_grande.jpg?v=1637723779","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_aee59174-ec62-4820-8143-b88d9fc89f05_grande.jpg?v=1637723779","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_cf81bcd0-9cf6-4d7c-baf5-466abe4846fd_grande.jpg?v=1637723779"]},{name:"Cream",girl:"Autumn Falls",url:"/en/texture/cream",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/cream.jpg",scores:[3.93,4.07,3.87,3.66,3.79,3.28,3.71,3.55,4.26,3.48,3.61,3.73,3.5,4.26],description:"Autumn Fall’s lady Fleshlight is everything you’d expect from this Puerto Rican pornstar sensation.

Finally, now is your chance to make this Latina princess’s pussy CREAM.",review:'<div class="text">\n<p>\nI got the Cream sleeve (and case, as it was a new offering, so you could only get it as a full FL kit) of Autumn Falls during the BF/CM sale of 2020, of which one plus of that sale was that newer FLGs were also part of the sale, provided you spent enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAesthetics: The Cream sleeve has a vaginal orifice that is the replica of Autumn Falls vulva, and with a Fleshtone that is very similar to Autumn Falls herself, this sleeve is already visually appealing. Yeah, I must confess: I oggled it with my eyes quite a bit each time before embarking on a FLight. <br/>\n<br/>\nLube: Since mid-2019, I have exclusively used Gun Oil H2O (do not use the original Gun Oil as it is a silcone lubricant that will damage your sleeves). Gun Oil H20 is great as it is a longer lasting lube, works very well with Fleshlight products and is formulated to help improve sexual activity. Although the Cream has various textures, Gun Oil H2O will go a long way with just a bit, and unless you are going on a major marathon of a FLight, re-lubing is usually not necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoise: The sleeve itself did not make much noise when penetrating, at all. Unless someone is watching you enjoy yourself, the noise ought not to be a factor in a closed room. Now, I didn\'t give this a perfect 5.0 because it does make a little noise, and with the Shower Mount that noise is a bit noticeable in the room, but again, unless someone either a) knows what that noise is or b) walsk in on you, it\'s not exactly something to get all riled up about.<br/>\n<br/>\nPenetration: When used in a Shower Mount, Cream is... alright with initial penetration. You can feel the various constricting "gates" that lead to each new texture up through the "waffle/lattice". However, on its own (such as the FL being held by the hand or other handless methods), the sensations are more noticeable. That being said, what really sells this sleeve is...<br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: With a Shower Mount, it takes time for intensity to build, but it does get there. However, using the FL with your hand, or with the FL inserted for a hands free experience other than the Shower Mount (maybe with a Launch, or inserted into something else, some still swear by sticking the FL in a good ol\' shoe), and the intensity dials up even more quickly. With the Shower Mount, I was able to go for well around ten minutes (perhaps due to a larger air hole that is in the base of the mount, so that dials down the intensity just a tad, so the Mount doesn\'t rip off the wall). But other FLights sans Shower Mount? Definitely more intense and one FLight, in particular, was over in three minutes if that. This increasing intensity lets you know you are heading to a strong finish, regardless of what method you FLy. <br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm: With an FL, there are three orgasms that tend to come about (pun intended). One is a gentle buildup that leads to a nice orgasm. Another is one that causes you to cum without warning. The last is a "when you blow, you know." Cream is more of the third item, with some flavorings of the first and second items in that previous list depending on how you want to FLy. However, all of them are quite enjoyable, and even the three-minute FLight I had was an orgasm that after it occurred had me chuckling for a few minutes, mentally admiring a rather quick but fulfilling experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleanup: The Cream is a varied texture, so using a copious stream of water and some finger scrubbing is helpful in removing the "deposits". If you want the interior of the sleeve dry in a reasonable time, use a high-quality paper towel (or if you use a low quality, economy-strength paper towel, be prepared to pick out the torn pieces...). With this, clean-up and dry times are fairly quick and much more reasonable, as I found myself considering seriously going for another round not long after the previous round, and this is a sleeve that may well make you want another go after your FLight.<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>The Cream is a surprisingly good sleeve that ILF took some risks in designing, and it\'s a winner. I can recommend this sleeve for both beginners (although you will get spoiled, it\'s that good) and experience FLyers alike. This sleeve edges out Luxe/Sugar for my highest rated sleeve, and I could see this as a first five-sleeves purchase for many, for a long time to come.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"December 15th, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/revtwentyseven",reviewer:"revtwentyseven",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_b4122740-eee0-4260-9787-af9ad92b09e6_grande.jpg?v=1627934175","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_f46d8758-6d6b-4a6e-8548-08949774326d_grande.jpg?v=1627934175","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_7be065c7-c215-424b-b034-7b9942e359ba_grande.jpg?v=1627934175","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_dea93bce-5f46-4b9a-b6d5-6096abd6f586_grande.jpg?v=1627934175","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_c49d6ffe-ac2b-4944-a223-53f901613b0f_grande.jpg?v=1627934175","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_69b896a7-2c26-4cf1-9734-e9e911cfc0c2_grande.jpg?v=1627934175"]},{name:"Cake",girl:"Griffin Barrows",url:"/en/texture/cake",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/cake.jpg",scores:[3.87,4.24,4.37,4.06,4.19,4.19,3.24,4.37,4.42,3.89,3.59,3.74,3.82,4.26],description:"Griffin Barrows' Fleshjack is everything you’d anticipate from one of porn’s hottest power bottoms.

If you're looking for an intense ride, use just enough lube to be comfortable. If you want a smoother experience, use more lube.

The reason this sleeve was purchased was the chamber 3/4 of the way down it is very similar to the first chamber in the fit. It is also a beautiful mold and one of my favorites I own. The oriface is not a true selling point but it is nice to have a pretty little hole to have.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst impressions is this sleeve is TIGHT. So tight it sucks you and and massages you the whole way. As a matter of fact it is so tight when you pull out is farts lol. After the tight entrance the first entrance pops opens and sucks in your tip and helps you glide into the next small bumpy chamber. The next chamber isnt anything to complain about bus is also nothing to rant about. The next little node is a tight spiraled almost second entrance. And you power though that you are greeted by a wonderful chamber that delights you tip. Lube amount isnt heavy but is more than some of my other sleeves. Clean up was not to bad and neither was drying.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>At he end of the day this is up with the punk as one of my favorite anal sleeves.

Since then I have accrued a collection of 24 Full-Sized sleeves and 1 Quickshot. Before making any detailed review I make sure to have at least used the Sleeve more than 5 times. Not in a single go either but at natural time periods. This way I can provide an accurate description and review of what you are looking for as a FLyer. I also tend to use Gun Oil H2O, Onatsuyu P Juice, or Fleshlube. My measurements are 7.2 in x 5.5 in. I don't discuss Cleanup/Maintenance in reviews because everyone does things differently. My way won't be the same as others, the point is to just clean your FL and prevent it from getting mold. So whatever works best for you stick by it. I review best by chambers so if you are looking for measurements and all that I will only apply them when it's needed in important texture details. Remember my opinion is my own so if you do not resonate with my review then feel free to do more research and review hunting on your desired FL product. If you liked reading the review thumbs it up and Happy FLying!</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nMisty Stone a X-rated legend at this point has been tearing up the game for years. I remember watching her before I even knew what a FL was. Naturally in her success she partnered with FL in 2010 to not only bring us 3 Orifices, but to also shake up the room and give us a new FleshTone in the form of a FLG. This will be a review on the Anal texture 'Desire' which is my first FL and the only anal texture I own as of writing this review.<br/>\n<br/>\nImpression<br/>\nBeing my first FL 'Desire' looked incredibly detailed in it's initial look but now after owning many I have to say that this orifice is well made and offers the contrast you are looking for when compared to other FLs. My orifice started to tear at the entrance so I try not to use it much these days but it's very hot to look at the entrance and the way you can see the slit beneath. It definitely grips around your fingers. Out of all my fleshlights this is one of my most durable but as I've heard it can be the case that the older produced models were made with a more durable material?? Not sure if it's true but from what I can tell it's not much of a difference. 'Desire' definitely speaks for itself when you look at it. A wrinkled brown FleshTone that wants you inside. Penetration feels rigid in a good way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSensation<br/>\nTo start off 'Desire' we are introduced to a medium sized chamber that starts off with a small section of ribs that branch off to a tunnel of protruding pyramids. This First chamber at penetration can feel rough and maybe too stimulating at faster paces but it provides a barrage of pleasure when thrusting through that feels good to rub against. Next up in the Second chamber you enter through a tight cave that feels like pushing through a less noticeable node which then opens up to a wide ring. This is mirrored directly after and feels like one huge lotus node. It's unexplainable unless you enter but the effect it gives when you thrust through is like a soft punch with a tighter grip unlike the first chamber and it's pyramids. In this chamber you also are met with a feeling that grabs your whole shaft or head subtly before the next chamber. In the final chamber after the grip of the second chamber you are thrown directly inter soft fins that line the entirety of the walls. these fins feel dangerously intense as you push through but when you pull back you are met with a smooth sensation that can prematurely disrupt your focus. it's a much less rough feeling going into and out of this chamber unlike the first but the stimulation is definitely there. Going deep is ideal with this sleeve as the backstroke can feel differently and starts to amp up the pressure. Tightening the cap on this sleeve is noticeable but not Flight changing. It can grip on you very well screwed all the way in and doesn't lower stimulation. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinal Thoughts<br/>\n'Desire' definitely fills your cravings if you want but it's true purpose is to tire you out and leave you sore. The stimulation this sleeve gives is unmatched to most of my collection. The chambers blend well to provide constant and noticeable stimulation. 'Desire' is a loose sleeve by nature but it gets tight in the right ways and screwing the cap all the way is a testament of that. Going for long periods of time with the sleeve can leave you sore if you have a sensitive member so keep that in mind. 'Desire' also has a balanced way of stimulating both the shaft and head nicely. Using 'Desire' feels like a wild bumpy ride with a kinky friend. Tossing and turning then pushing against you as the playfighting turns animalistic. A wild ride indeed.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Misty Stone's 'Desire' is a wondrous texture that seems to fulfill the fantasies of many delighted fans. If anyone is looking for a new texture I would recommend this sleeve to anyone looking for a sleeve that they want to feel push against them and hug the right places noticably or to anyone that wants a loose anal sleeve with variety. </p>\n</div>",review_time:"March 19th, 2022",reviewer_url:"/en/u/frequentflyerrrr",reviewer:"FrequentFLyerrrr",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Misty-Gallery_0000_IMG_0615_grande.jpg?v=1539621720","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Misty-Gallery_0001_IMG_0033_grande.jpg?v=1539621720","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Misty-Gallery_0002_IMG_0535_grande.jpg?v=1539621720","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Misty-Gallery_0003_IMG_0012_1_grande.jpg?v=1539621720","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Misty-Gallery_0004_IMG_0529_grande.jpg?v=1539621720","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Misty-Gallery_0005_IMG_0024_grande.jpg?v=1539621720","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Misty-Gallery_0006_IMG_0463_grande.jpg?v=1539621720","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Misty-Gallery_0007_IMG_0064_grande.jpg?v=1539621720"]},{name:"Sinner",girl:"Kissa Sins",url:"/en/texture/sinner",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/sinner.jpg",scores:[3.86,4.04,4.34,4.04,3.85,3.28,3.54,3.15,4.18,3.6,3.37,3.44,3.23,4.24],description:"If you love anal sex or have butt sex fantasies and REALLY want to experience what it feels like to stuff yourself inside of a tight butthole, Kissa Sins's Sinner Fleshlight is for you.

The end of year sale determined that I would become it's rightful owner, along with it's sister orifice: insatiable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's intense, but less so than other butt textures like punk and next level. Nevertheless, it is a real contender for the position of best butt sleeve (imo) as it offers more variability and versatility than the other two, meaning you can get different experiences from it on different days.<br/>\nWhat they'll have in common is that they will probably all be pretty great.<br/>\nThis texture (along with next level) might be my favourite for the sensation you get when entering the orifice. It has a swirly/vortex in the very first chamber which makes for an intriguing and stimulating entry right off the bat, followed by tighter chambers. Probably the tightest texture I own, the sensations produced by the bumps and nodules in the latter two chambers are amplified as a result of the narrowing width of the passage. And since they are varied, there is a plethora of sensations to be had here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is probably my favourite butt sleeve, and probably my go to for anal flights. If I had to lose all my butt sleeves but one, I would hold onto this one. That's because it is intense, but not relentlessly so (like punk), thus making for an ideal texture for dragged out play and exploration.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>This may well be the sleeve to have if you like butt stuff and sleeves that are on the intense side but not finishers like Punk. It's tight, it's unlike any other texture, and it has plenty of variety. It's a sin that it doesn't have more praise and recognition.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 31st, 2019",reviewer_url:"/en/u/burnmybelongings",reviewer:"burnmybelongings",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_b78fd904-d5c2-42cf-b986-c4f74bb2f165_grande.jpg?v=1670960784","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_beb84d46-669c-424f-a504-b253e5e6e0da_grande.jpg?v=1670960784","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_3adbc3a8-d552-488b-b656-9c9a0cd40557_grande.jpg?v=1670960784","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_9fb64eb8-1df5-4b49-9bdb-e357c26560df_grande.jpg?v=1670960784","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_1ad80e2f-35e5-468a-b6f6-00d5843b3970_grande.jpg?v=1670960784","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_336b240b-6901-4400-83f8-2e8a00fde8be_grande.jpg?v=1670960784"]},{name:"Shameless",girl:"Brandi Love",url:"/en/texture/shameless",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/shameless.jpg",scores:[4.05,4.06,4.15,4.08,3.97,3.27,3.38,3.21,4.25,3.54,3.46,3.45,3.2,4.23],description:"Be the first to go where no man has gone before, Brandi Love's butt!

Experience the layers of twisting texture before being thrust through a tight notched centerpiece directly into a cascade of ribbing. This Fleshlight will take your breath away and make you explode!",review:"<div class=\"text\">\n<p>\nI picked up this sleeve with the Boom in the 2023 Black Friday sale. For context, I don't feel any particularly way for Blake, but her sleeves looked really interesting. Reviewed after 3rd Flight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Case:<br/>\nA pretty standard full size case with a nice pearlised finish. It's almost pretty. I've seen people reporting issues with the case, namely the support ring inside being loose or even unattached on arrival, for both this and the Boom. I had no issues with either. The support rod felt a little sharp at the top and bottom but I couldn't see any signs of damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Sleeve:<br/>\nOh boy. The sleeve was surprisingly soft on unpacking, it almost felt like someone had been pounding it on my behalf so it would arrive broken-in. The lips at the entrance are soft, squishy and pleasingly asymmetrical. The lips stretch nicely on entering and they definitely add a little something on the stroke. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis sleeve starts with a twisted cavern of nubs that look quite stiff and as though they may make the entrance quite intense - this was in fact my main reason for purchasing it - I wanted an edging sleeve. Bombshell more than delivered. That initial cavern was much softer on entry than expected and felt surprisingly realistic. I would say the first 45 minutes of my first flight with Blake was spent in this first chamber. From there you move into a tighter canal, then into what appear to be a set of offset half lotus nodes, followed by a tighter ribbed section. Overall I'd say it's a fairly tight sleeve with great variety, if you like ribbing, but it's also decently smooth and seems to loosen up a touch when really going for it. I must be lucky, because there's a definite twist all the way down the texture, and as I'm also a little twisted at the base in the same direction, this seemed to be almost designed just for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe initial chamber is a divine holy land of pleasure that took way too much of my attention, and pushing through this into the ribbed canals beyond was extremely satisfying for me. It really felt like pushing into a pussy. And it still felt like it after a couple more flights. While I think there's still a little breaking-in to do with this sleeve, it was remarkably... ready... for action on opening. I think the sleeve material is a little softer than others I've tried, though this is my first FLG sleeve. The Boost Blow doesn't feel quite the same, and that surprised me with its softness too. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Feelings:<br/>\nI could wax lyrical here but I'll just say it - I flew for 3 hours with this sleeve on the first flight and had the most intense orgasm of my life. While the sleeve itself is quite tight, but not excessively so, it just seemed to accommodate everything I wanted to do perfectly. Subsequent flights have also been comparable. Perhaps it's because it's new, or maybe it just really is... perfect (for me). I feel like I could edge in the first two chambers... forever, if I really wanted to. In fact, the first flight ended with me realising how late it was and having to shift up a gear to finish. I was just lost in there. When I shifted up, the texture felt like it loosened to accommodate longer, faster strokes and from nowhere, a very satisfying milking sensation appeared. I made a big mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Rest:<br/>\nClean up has been absolutely fine, standard I'd say, with the texture requiring very little special attention to get clean. Likewise, drying time seems about standard - it was ready for the next flight in less than a day.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>As always these things are entirely subjective but I found this sleeve to be.. well, it has earned its name, for sure. Long edging sessions? She's got you covered. Fast, tight, intense sessions? Yep, she's got you covered. Be very careful with this sleeve as it may take more of your time than you realise. </p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 4th, 2023",reviewer_url:"/en/u/sheriffd",reviewer:"SheriffD",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/BlakeBlossom-Webassets-Gallery6_grande.jpg?v=1700675591","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/BlakeBlossom-Webassets-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1700675590","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/BlakeBlossom-Webassets-Gallery4_grande.jpg?v=1700675590","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/BlakeBlossom-Webassets-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1700675590","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/BlakeBlossom-Webassets-Gallery2_grande.jpg?v=1700675590","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/BlakeBlossom-Webassets-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1700675590"]},{name:"Rebel",girl:"Kimmy Granger",url:"/en/texture/rebel",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/rebel.jpg",scores:[3.66,3.97,3.86,4,3.82,3.57,3.04,3.79,4.15,3.61,3.8,3.89,3.61,4.22],description:"By definition a rebel goes against the odds, is feisty, is defiant.

I use Gun Oil H2O (water based) or Fleshlight Fleshwater - check the LUBE section to see which one I reccomend for the sleeve being reviewed.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nINTRO:<br/>\nSo here we are - my first review. I choose that to be my all-time favourite sleeve which is REBEL of Kimmy Granger. It is my #1 based on many things. <br/>\nFor my review I choose it because of numeric data – it was the most popular sleeve (in last 40 weeks) amongst these, which I own. <br/>\nREBEL competed with 13 others – ATTACK, TASTY, DIVINITY, FIT, OBSESSION, STORM, NEXT LEVEL, EMPRESS, DESTROYA, INDULDGE, LVL UP, BARRACUDA and FORBIDDEN. It reached the first place with 41 sessions in 40 weeks (for the details of the test check photos on my profile). <br/>\n<br/>\nTHE FANTASY:<br/>\nKimmy is not a pornstar like we thought a pornstar should look like in the 90’s or early XX century. She is not a blonde with 90/60/90 measurements (big breasts) – all American girl as we usually see Playmates or it’s adult industry counterparts like Jenna Jameson, Kayden Kross, Samantha Saint, Kagney Lynn Karter or even (not technically a blonde) nowadays #1 body which is obviously Lana Rhodes. Kimmy is more of a girl next door, wearing jeans - the companion that you are comfortable spending time with, joking and doing stuff. I would definitely put her in a category that Riley Reid created over a past decade – a rebellious girl next door that doesn’t care about society rules, restrictions and is wickedly smiling at you, teasing just with her eyes. The girl that you desire not from a deep lust based on physical desire or social status that comes with it. You do not want to be with Kimmy because you lust for wild performance and amazing, primal orgasms that ensures you of your male dominant sexual features, while she represents the perfect embodiment of female characteristics. It is the exact opposite of all of that – you want “the day off”. You want to put all that stuff aside and just enjoy the time with a girl that you like. To be with that rebel, wearing jeans, eating popcorn from one bowl, while watching a horror movie during which things go in the direction of “accidental” caressing and then the main thing. Does the sleeve stands up to that expectation – I say YES, and that is why it is my personal winner.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE CHARACTERISTICS:<br/>\nSo how is REBEL in action? I say it is SOFT. What it means? Well, it means that you are not encountering any hard obstacles during penetration (perfect example of really HARD sleeves are INDULDGE by Angela White and then STORM by Romi Rain). The effect of its SOFTNESS is that the intensity is not generated straight-forward in-your-face style right away. REBEL stimulates you gently, in an unobtrusive/shy way – it basically gives you time and freedom to get accustomed to it and just enjoy. Exactly the way Kimmy would do. These small bumps and rings are moderately noticeable but they do the work with time getting you higher and higher while Kimmy is wickedly smiling at you. The orgasm is amazing as it feels as it is gradually worked to be the peak of the encounter. That gradual and stable increase of excitement is enabling you to reach VERY HIGH levels of pleasure. As there is no rapid change of texture and intensity, you are able to have a decent amount of control (nothing will jinx you) during the penetration – more control, longer sessions, higher level of pleasure – she has GREAT potential. Talking about control there is one more thing that has to be mentioned…<br/>\nIs the REBEL tight? Yes, it is tight, as you would expect from a rather small girl – there is a logic here. Its tightness is constant all-over the way. The effect is that Kimmy is always in touch with you, she never leaves you. She sticks with you and never gives you back. The result is that if you start to penetrate her, you will finish with her, it is no way back and no rest. Especially “no-rest” can sound overwhelming, but trust me, it is gently and unobtrusive overwhelming – very pleasurable but still one-way ticket. It steadily and gradually arouse you but has no breaks. If you get experienced with Kimmy, she will allow you to stay in that VERY high level of excitement for a relatively long time - which is simply amazing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSPECIAL APPLICATIONS:<br/>\nMetronome style (stroking to the defined beat while watching video): NO <br/>\nThe sleeve does not deal well with fast stroking due to its tightness – it is not “effective” (for a lack of better word) to stroke fast with REBEL for longer time. Looser sleeves work much better in that case.<br/>\nStroke, Stop, Stroke, Edge: PERFECT <br/>\nAs you will have some decent time for warming-up arousal, then you get into high level of excitement - place where you can really see the potential of REBEL<br/>\nJust Edging and Resting: NOT SO GOOD <br/>\nIt is hard to reach edge quickly with this one, and simply not worth it. It is not destined for that, as it requires decent amount of arousal-building to reach “the edging-realm”. The process is by itself pleasurable - enforcing edges quickly nullify that experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE LUBE: <br/>\nGunoil H2O, STANDARD amount (even a little less than average is required to fully enjoy it)<br/>\nThe review is based on H2O Gunoil (water based) lube, which is my recommendation for that sleeve. In general SOFT and detailed sleeves require the thinnest lube possible which is H2O Gunoil (water based), while the HARD sleeves require denser lube which is Fleshlight Fleshwater. Lube matters a lot and in this case H2O Gunoil is the lube to fully encounter what REBEL has to offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE MAINTENANCE:<br/>\nSTANDARD drying time, and STANDARD powdering.<br/>\n<br/>\nCOMPETITION (something in similar style if you liked this one)<br/>\nElsa Jean TASTY<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>It is very good for beginners (however I recommend Elsa Jean TASTY as 1st Fleshlight). Definetely worth to acquire as 2nd or 3rd sleeve. My best sleeve for every-day use with gradual increase of intensity and Very High End Game (Maximal Level of Pleasure is Very High). My S+ grade as the most used amongst all the Fleshlights I possess - definetely well tested (41 FLights during 40 weeks) - check my profile for a graph in photos.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"December 13th, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/koqwax",reviewer:"Koqwax",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_be166a3b-6add-4f6a-952d-5368a348c218_grande.jpg?v=1620156788","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_01b5d2b8-bc04-4fcb-a9a9-89c2ded46091_grande.jpg?v=1620156788","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_7e6da351-f519-45d9-8772-c66a4c4f1808_grande.jpg?v=1620156789","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_ec84fd44-ae40-498a-bc09-ec5657022773_grande.jpg?v=1620156787","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_cb30ad29-31ed-447b-a22b-033c7b7c2df6_grande.jpg?v=1620156786","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_22d14f57-4b1a-4767-902d-cee8fb7ddde8_grande.jpg?v=1620156788"]},{name:"Karma",girl:"Lana Rhoades",url:"/en/texture/karma",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/karma.jpg",scores:[3.91,3.99,4.17,3.76,3.81,3.41,3.28,3.4,4.1,3.57,3.57,3.77,3.52,4.21],description:"If you have experienced anal sex, you will immediately feel how real Lana Rhoades’s Karma Fleshlight is.

Given the dearth of reviews for this sleeve, I decided it was time to give it a review.<br/>\n<br/>\nAesthetics: As this is a "butt" sleeve, there is a butthole, which... well everyone has one of those. However, this particuar sleeve is quite oddly pleasing, due the shape of Lana Rhoades\' cheeks (as best as a FL can replicate) are well defined as well as the mold including part of her labia as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nLube: Since mid-2019, I have exclusively used Gun Oil H2O (do not use the original Gun Oil as it is a silcone lubricant that will damage your sleeves). Gun Oil H20 is great as it is a longer lasting lube, works very well with Fleshlight products and is formulated to help improve sexual activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoise: This sleeve did make a small bit of noise, due to the end cap being slightly looser, but unless someone is literally watching FLy, this is not exactly something of concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nPenetration: Entering the Karma sleeve has several different feelings based on how the endcap is on. If the endcap is on and tight, the sleeeve quickly grabs ahold of you and you can feel the suction the more you penetrate and thrust. Otherwise, the sleeve gets a little looser and you can definitely feel the spaces in each of the triangular caverns as well as the rings of rings. Either setup leads to a great experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: The Karma is strangly not a super intense sleeve, even if you have the ventilation cap all the way on. However, as you continue to thrust, you will become more aware of the sensations in the sleeve, especially if you are more endowed, as the chambers do narrow the further you go.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm: With a FL, there are three orgasms that tend to come about (pun intended). One is a gentle buildup that leads to a nice orgasm. Another is one that causes you to cum without warning. The last is a "when you blow, you know." The Goddess is some of the first and the third. The Karma texture is primarily the first type. It takes time to get to the finish line with this sleeve, but it is well worth it. You can certainly have a quick romp with the Karma, but I feel those sessions are considerbly less rewarding than taking your time.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleanup: Given the spacious chambers of the Karma (and even considering the narrowing along the sleeve), this sleeve is not terribly hard to cleanup and dry. A good rinsing with water followed by drying the inner canal with a paper towel is sufficient to accelerate the drying process to a reasonable time.<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>The Karma is a welcome addition to anyone\'s collection, especially for those interested in butt sleeves. Even if one is more partial to the "Lady" sleeves, the Karma is definitely worth exploring, regardless, and a experienced FLyer should have this texture in their collection.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"December 21st, 2019",reviewer_url:"/en/u/revtwentyseven",reviewer:"revtwentyseven",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Lana-WebAssetsGallery_1_grande.jpg?v=1617906068","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Lana-WebAssetsGallery_2_grande.jpg?v=1617906068","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Lana-WebAssetsGallery_3_grande.jpg?v=1617906068","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Lana-WebAssetsGallery_4_grande.jpg?v=1617906068","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Lana-WebAssetsGallery_5_grande.jpg?v=1617906068","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Lana-WebAssetsGallery_6_grande.jpg?v=1617906068"]},{name:"Fit",girl:"Nicole Aniston",url:"/en/texture/fit",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/fit.jpg",scores:[3.95,4.09,3.66,3.01,3.38,3.12,3.84,3.23,4.19,3.59,3.67,3.84,3.71,4.21],description:"Fit is our newest sensation featuring riveting ribbed-nodules SuperSkin technology made for stamina interval training.

I'm an 7.25 in. long and 5.75 inch girth. I inspect each sleeve for texture, uniformity and I use the sleeve 3 times before committing to a review. That way I'm thorough and as detailed as possible. Your ticket to find out exactly what you want before you buy. It's time to review our next Fleshlight! <br/>\n<br/>\nNicole Aniston’s Fit texture is designed to help increase sexual stamina. I had tried the STU (Stamina Training Unit) in the past and found it extremely intense so I was expecting something similar from the Fit, despite it looking quite different at first glance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sleeve is entered through the orifice, which accurately imitates Nicole’s own pussy lips. Inside, it is broken up into four sections with varying textures, and a couple of tighter constrictions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first section is lined with three ribs which run along the length of the walls, twisting to create a slight spiraling sensation. Each rib is topped with six roughly rectangular bumps. This first chamber ends just under 2.4” (61mm) from the entrance of the sleeve.<br/>\n<br/>\nA ring of medium sized circular bumps comes next, followed quickly by three more rings of tiny bumps, offset against each other, and two smooth raised rings. The chamber ends in a tight constriction, made with large rectangular bumps topped with smaller rounded bumps.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sleeve widens into the third main chamber just over 5.1” (130mm) from the entrance. Here is the most unusual part of the Fit texture: a series of bumps shaped like elongated triangles, which slope gradually up a ‘point’ at one end.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, almost 7” (177mm) from the beginning of the sleeve is the fourth chamber. It is entered through a tight constriction and is lined with four rings of medium sized bumps. The walls of this chamber widen slightly toward the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Nicole Aniston Fit starts stimulating you from the moment you first enter the sleeve with its multiple bumps and ridges. However, the different sections mean that the texture does change as you move through it and it is not as overwhelming as the STU.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entrance feels quite wide, so the initial stimulation is gentle and not very obvious immediately. The ridges in the first section feel like they are winding around the penis and drawing you into the sleeve, with the added stimulation of the small bumps on the sensitive head of the penis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe constrictions in the sleeve are noticeable but some of the more delicate textures are not obvious and tend to blend into one. However, the overall effect is reasonably intense and the many bumps create small points of stimulation, especially as arousal increases. The Fit sleeve did lead to a fairly quick orgasm and I can see why it would make a good stamina training sleeve.<br/>\n<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Compared to the STU, which overstimulated to the point of being almost painful, I found the Fit to be a somewhat less intense and more enjoyable. The texture is not as obvious due to the variety, but the varied width and small constrictions add to the effect and it certainly delivers a mind blowing orgasm.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"October 3rd, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/stiffpoles",reviewer:"stiffpoles",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/NicoleAniston-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1556728777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/NicoleAniston-Gallery2_grande.jpg?v=1556728777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/NicoleAniston-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1556728777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/NicoleAniston-Gallery4_grande.jpg?v=1556728777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/NicoleAniston-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1556728777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/NicoleAniston-Gallery6_grande.jpg?v=1556728777"]},{name:"Ethereal",girl:"Eliza Ibarra",url:"/en/texture/ethereal",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/ethereal.jpg",scores:[3.46,3.85,3.91,3.38,3.59,3.76,3.47,3.62,4.05,3.46,3.58,4.02,3.7,4.21],description:"Eliza Ibarra's pussy Fleshlight, “Ethereal,” is too perfect for this world!

This Fleshlight lives up to its name - it's Wild and will make you hungry for more.\n\nFrom Riley’s little and sweet pussy, an orifice described in a Wild texture has been moulded right down to the last detail.

It's nice, but it's not fantastic. What I like about it is it isn't fragile like some of them are. I had to have the both of them in the rotation at the same time to notice this, but it actually seems like a more varied cousin to the obsession texture. The penetration of the two is almost identical with the wild being a little bit wider. I had to have them side by side to notice, though. Above average intensity and orgasm quality. It's really tough for me to gauge orgasm quality because the longer I last in the sleeve, the better the orgasm is. This is universal for all my textures. That said, it still seems a little bit above average in that department. I didn't notice much suction, but I use the shower mount with a make shift block on the end to prevent air from escaping. Those of you that have the shower mount know it basically has holes in the end that seriously limit the suction. I have mine semi-blocked, but air still leaks in and out. <br/>\n<br/>\nI actually think my comparison between Wild and Obsession is the way for me to be of the most use for current buyers. Anybody looking at one should look into the other. Don't just look at the texture itself, but also consider how much of each you'll be able to reach. For anybody of average size or lower, the difference between the two is really going to be a small part of the texture. For that reason, I really wouldn't advise anybody to get both at the same time unless you're at least above average so the difference is more noticeable. As mentioned above, Wild is a little looser, but also easier to clean for those who worry about that.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Above average intensity sleeve with a lot of similarity to Obsession for most sized users. Wild has more variety and is a little looser. Definitely look into both and keep your individual size in mind when choosing. Tightness is average and should exclude anybody due to being too wide or narrow. Length shouldn't be a factor, but longer penises will get more variety in the texture. </p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 18th, 2019",reviewer_url:"/en/u/bustanut",reviewer:"bustanut",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Spice",girl:"Eva Lovia",url:"/en/texture/spice",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/spice.jpg",scores:[3.59,3.86,4.09,4.02,3.98,4.08,3.27,3.98,4.09,3.74,3.87,4.11,4.05,4.2],description:"Eva Lovia's Butt",review:"<div class=\"text\">\n<p>\nCleanup: 9/10 (This texture in particular I found to clean up very easily. There is no parts in the texture that really grab or hold a lot of fluid or any junk of that kind. With the exception of the opening part, right after the tight entrance, I'm talking specifically about the part at 2 and a half inches. Even with that part being there, it really doesn't hold anything for long and a simple 60 seconds under the sink at most will do the job every time. Unless you got some crazy amounts of sperm, but hey that is something to be proud of. Everything else cleans well above average and dries fairly quickly when compared to other fleshlights, and especially when compared to onaholes. If I had to compare it to a dry time on a fleshlight, it would be pretty similar to the Swallow, which I would say is a pretty impressive job. Overall, very happy and impressed with how fast the dry time and cleaning is, it's not going to clean up like a coffee cup, obviously because it's still a fleshlight with textures closed within a space. With that in mind though, very good. Might be the new standard along with the Swallow for dry time and cleanup.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside feel: 9/10 (Besides it obviously being a fleshlight, and unless you have some sort of setup, you will be grabbing a plastic flashlight handle... It is pretty damn good. The execution of the actual fleshlight sleeve on the orifice is quite impressive. The asshole is quite big, and the asscheeks are both quite pronounced outwards, which is hard to see online. It really does feel like this girl who has this huge ass, and this is her asshole. The asscheeks do add a lot of dimension, pressing into you it creates the realistic feel of asscheeks pressing on you. This is really well done, because it is a fleshlight and isn't a torso, or a hip, or anything of the nature. It's just a sleeve, yet the feeling it gives off of an ass is quite amazing. Overall, I didn't think I'd say this... but I like this more than my hip in terms of feel on the sleeve itself. It has a better ass than any hip or torso I own. Also it has a better ass, mind you by a slim margin, than my Stoya Epic texture. It's just like the Epic texture is like this smaller white girl's ass, and Spice is like some girl who plays volleyball and is like 6 feet tall kind of ass. I will admit, this might have a lot to do with preference and whatnot... so the Epic could easily outmatch this if you are into that kind of thing over a bigger ass... but for my book this beats that. The asshole texture itself is also well done, and the wrinkles of the asshole all feel very realistic. The amount of \"tight hole\" in the beginning of the texture, also serves a dual purpose of reinforcing the asshole itself. Creating a sturdier, tighter asshole, that holds the shape of the texture of the asshole orifice amazingly, and holds up even under usage and lube. Very very well done. Best asshole and ass shape I've found in any toy thus far.)<br/>\n<br/>\nInside feel: 9/10 (I initially got this for the part that basically is from 0 inches to 2.25 inches. In my head, I looked at all the other textures... found this one, and immediately noticed a difference. No other texture really has this ultra tight, ribbed beginning part, that even has that rolling crescent shape that you can see. Where the ribs curve up into the hole at 1.5 inches. Well, I am happy to report that it does indeed feel really really good. Also really tight, as tight as my Extra Virgin onahole can be... but honestly this one feels tighter because of the amount of length that the tight part actually goes on for. 2 inches of tightness is a lot, I mean it's not crazy but it is quite a lot. Opening back up into that grooved pinching area at 3 inches also feels great, as does when it opens up after that. I imagine that if you were longer, at 7 inches it has a pinch again, which must feel pretty good. Although, I will say that it does look a little bland of a texture at 7 inches, where it is just tight and no real stimulation past that... so if you are smaller don't worry you won't miss much. You have to use a decent amount of lube with this texture, not insane amounts but it is very tight and requires more. For an anal experience, I guess that does make sense, although I know a lot of people who could get by with much less lube than this fleshlight haha. The feeling of fucking it is great, and inside it does feel like a very tight asshole is gripping down upon you. It is certainly an experience that I wouldn't want to miss out on if you are into anal.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSound: 8/10 (Weird thing but this is probably one of my least loud fleshlights. I thought with all of the suction and the tightness of it, that it would make a ton of noise. Honestly, outside of the one time it popped out of the fleshlight plastic tube holder thing, where it did make noise... obviously haha... it didn't make that much noise at all. I think overall it is probably my quietest fleshlight or onahole that I own. It is really nice, because even though I'm not stealthing it up, it is nice to not have to worry about much noise at all anyway. It is still a fleshlight, so it's going to make some noise, but otherwise I really think if you have stealth as a priority, I would really consider this one. Just be careful about pulling out, and also know that there is a lot of suction going on here.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDurability: 9/10 (Needless to say, this is a fleshlight made in the modern times, so this is built like a tank and will last many many years with the proper care. In terms of durability, one of the best options you can choose on the market are fleshlights for these type of toys. Worth it in this category by a mile.)<br/>\n<br/>\nStimulation: 6/10 (The stimulation for me was lower than most fleshlights, because there is no real intricate textures or weird tentacles coming at you. To be honest though, in real assholes there isn't much texture either, so I'd say maybe it just had to go with that. Real assholes don't have extreme tightness like this fleshlight does however, and I would say the stimulation is average, to above average. But because of other factors, the low stimulation is actually sort of a benefit, because it is more realistic. However, I do have to give this a lower rating here, just because I have to be honest with you guys. It wasn't really a homerun with stimulation, it is fairly basic on the inside, even though the inside does have a ton of good to it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm: 9/10 (The orgasms were enhanced by the low stimulation, causing a longer buildup, and also the tightness at the asshole being so great, that it sort of functions as a very light cockring. You do have to be fairly hard to get inside in the first place, but if that is not an issue, then the orgasms you can achieve with this are amazing. The suction also just drains your soul out of you because of the strength of the suction itself. It is just really really good for orgasms, but since there is low stimulation, you have to work up to it in a sense. However, once you get there I believe if we are just talking about orgasms themselves, this is up there with the best things I've tried. Maybe even the best, I do find myself coming back to it more often than not now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRealism: 8/10 (Okay well first off, the realism is here 100%. I love the feeling it gives and it is fairly accurate. However, I will mention that this is not some onahole that japanese scientists took and just made a perfect TPE replica of an assholes insides. Of course, this is not that. However, what it accomplishes with the tight opening, the asshole structure, the inside cavities leading up to tight spots and sort of ridged areas with openings and low texture... it does all create this realistic feel in my opinion anyway. The asscheeks are also an underrated nice touch. Overall, it's not a copy of an asshole, on the inside anyway, but it is close enough to be really really good. Probably the best anal, maybe epic has this beat in realism by a little... but it is close if anything. But for that tight asshole feeling, this knocks it out of the park.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFantasy: 9/10 (Yep, everything I mentioned above. The asscheeks shape, the asshole shape, the tightness on the inside providing support for the asshole and also providing a nice tight feeling... All lead into really good fantasy accomplishing sensations, if you are someone who enjoys fucking assholes anyway. Overall, very happy with this, the fantasy was most certainly achieved, for what a fleshlight can accomplish anyway, it exceeded my expectations. Fantasies are very specific and niche though, so don't take what I say here and just think this is the answer to your prayers, because while it is the answer to my own, we all have different tastes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPrice: 8/10 (You pretty much have to pay $80 dollars for this with the case, or $60 without the case. That being said, this is an above average deal for this kind of thing. As fleshlights are probably the most quality product for this type of masturbatory toy type. There is probably no other toy that will withstand the abuse, years of service, and still have new interesting things coming out, for this price. Seriously, I've looked at pretty much all the onaholes there are, and other european or american toys like this are just knock offs of fleshlight. Fleshlight are where it is at if you want to have a safe purchase, knowing you're getting your money's worth. Really, really good, albeit a bit expensive.)\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Between everything I used, this accomplished what it was after and designed for quite well. It does feel like an asshole, maybe not entirely realistically, but in my opinion well enough to accomplish the fantasy. This is like a super powered asshole, in feeling... in uh... my opinion. If I could find something that tops this, I would be happy, but I also wouldn't be sad if this was my best rated for a while.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"March 17th, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/knife_bro69",reviewer:"knife_bro69",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EvaLovia-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1556639770","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EvaLovia-Gallery2_grande.jpg?v=1556639770","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EvaLovia-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1556639770","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EvaLovia-Gallery4_grande.jpg?v=1556639770","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EvaLovia-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1556639770","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EvaLovia-Gallery6_0000_IMG_0750_grande.jpg?v=1556639770","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EvaLovia-Gallery6_0001_Layer_2_grande.jpg?v=1556639770","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EvaLovia-Gallery6_grande.jpg?v=1556639770","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EvaLovia-Gallery7_grande.jpg?v=1556639770","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EvaLovia-Gallery8_grande.jpg?v=1556639770"]},{name:"Luxe",girl:"Cherry Devivre",url:"/en/texture/luxe",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/luxe.jpg",scores:[3.96,4.07,4.09,3.33,3.58,3.45,4.04,3.51,4.15,3.53,3.66,3.76,3.62,4.2],description:"Surrender yourself to a tempestuous ride with Cherry Devivre's intense signature texture.

As an indication of preference, I'm not the biggest fan of overly tight sleeves because it's more difficult for me to discern the textures, even feel them for that matter. I prefer vaginal to anal sleeves, and usually use a sleeve at least a few times before reviewing. Drying time and realism are negligible ratings to me, since the Fleshlight dryer finishes every sleeve in an hour, and no Fleshlight that I've ever used feels similar to sex.<br/>\n<br/>\nI received the Luxe texture as a free mystery sleeve when buying the Violet Myers combo. Already, I perceived myself as lucky, since a vast majority of buyers were receiving the Cougar texture (which looked fairly boring in comparison). The sleeve itself is even ranked fairly high on this website despite not being in circulation (rank 89 at the time of writing). So in my gratitude, I decided to try it out, and to my surprise, the sleeve is pretty good!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere Luxe stands out the most is the uneven textures throughout its canals, though canals doesn't really seem to be the best descriptor since the sleeve is kind of one enormous chamber. But the first chamber is really the showcase of this, where alternating ridges are present that almost push into my member in different spots as I move within it. Push is a bit of an extrreme term, but Luxe has a sort of uneven canal feeling that shifts as the user penetrates without actually being an uneven canal (the example that comes to mind it Lvl Up).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second chamber is bookended by a series of larger nubs that constrict the sleeve ever so slightly. Since Luxe is actually pretty loose, the second chamber helps to squeeze the member and create further variation. I find myself gravitating to the second chamber more, since tight little choke points are probably my favorite sleeve texture overall and really help to put me over the edge; it's like penetrating a second orafice within the orafice. <br/>\n<br/>\nAltogether, this creates an obviously bumpy sensation that can sneak up on you if you arren't careful. The first few times I used Luxe, its looseness made it both easy and enticing to accelerate in, and I had a few surprising climaxes - which weren't smooth by any means, but not strong enough to make my leg shake.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, another great quality of this sleeve is how easy it is to clean and dry. I was curious and wanted to air dry it even though I own the Fleshlight Air, and the wideness of the canal made the process a very easy one. I'd recommend this sleeve to first time buyers, but unfortunately it isn't in circulation.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>3.6/5. In the context of free mystery sleeves, I couldn't really ask for a better addition than Luxe. The texture is a unique one as far as my collection is concerned, and although I don't use it as often as the others, I do get the craving once in awhile. I can't recommend it because it's limited though lol</p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 5th, 2022",reviewer_url:"/en/u/ian678",reviewer:"Ian678",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Exotica",girl:"Vina Sky",url:"/en/texture/exotica",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/exotica.jpg",scores:[3.84,3.96,4.09,3.89,3.95,3.4,3.57,3.62,4.14,3.66,3.67,3.76,3.55,4.2],description:"Designed to be as tight and stimulating as the girl herself, “Exotica” is an elaborate texture that begins with a twisty cyclone passageway intended to pull you inward welcomingly.

I am 7x5 for those who care and I use Astroglide. This review is gonna be in depth cause this shit isn’t cheap and won’t get cheaper for a while<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting off, happy with the color choice, it’s accurate which is cool. I was excited when this sleeve was announced knowing what I’ve heard from her on social media she will want her product to sell very well. It’s just that extra attention to detail. Some girls are tanner irl than their sleeve texture is and that can irk some, justifiably. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first chambers waffle texture is really fantastic for all types of your uses. I’m really glad they brought this to the front of the sleeve; as size consideration with where you place textures is very important in my opinion. If they are reading our stuff then kudos. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is gonna send you towards a ring that you sorta see in the boost series. But for me, unlike the bang. They nailed this one. This approach is softer and feels less like a cockring. It really give you this bj affect in some scenarios. I’m going to continue this praise <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond chamber is amazing and my personal favorite. The ridges continue that intensity and really is fun when you flip the sleeve mid flight. <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, the final chamber feels a bit tight for my top bit. I feel like this was a good safe choice to wrap up the sleeve since in my experiences it’s smoother. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExtras to consider. This sleeve is quiet, I’m so glad they nailed that one here for me. I think if you’re at same or more you’ll be fine just play with the cap. Cleaning is okay it can take awhile to dry but no worries. The O’s are a “when you know you know” kinda deal for me. I feel like I can choose when I’m ready to and that’s my preference.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>I think they did us all a favor with this for many consumers. If you like intense sleeves I would be hard pressed if one of these chambers doesn’t hit your preferences. I actually do recommend this as a first five sleeve. I understand some collect, some also like to only hold 1-2 at a time so feedback is important. I’d say if you had me rank this. I would say it is #2 behind only Ice Exotica for me. Ahead of Vivacious, Waifu, Cream, Squirt so on. But that is just in my experiences and all of us vary. </p>\n</div>',review_time:"July 11th, 2023",reviewer_url:"/en/u/lostdescription",reviewer:"LostDescription",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/Kazumi-Webassets-Gallery2_grande.jpg?v=1685373191","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/Kazumi-Webassets-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1685372884","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/Kazumi-Webassets-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1685372872","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/Kazumi-Webassets-Gallery4_grande.jpg?v=1685372870","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/Kazumi-Webassets-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1685372870","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/Kazumi-Webassets-Gallery6_grande.jpg?v=1685372870","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/Kazumi-Webassets-Gallery7_grande.jpg?v=1685372871","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/files/Kazumi-Webassets-Gallery8_grande.jpg?v=1685372871"]},{name:"Zombie Mouth",girl:"",url:"/en/texture/zombie-mouth",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/zombie-mouth.jpg",scores:[3.09,3.67,3.93,2.9,3.7,2.53,2.97,2.87,3.97,3.28,3.32,3.35,3.24,4.17],description:"Contrary to popular belief, most zombies don't want to eat your brain.

Since I was getting Abella’s Zone sleeve I decided to just throw this one in with it to have both. I didn’t know what to expect out of it after looking at the texture, many were new to me but it looked interesting enough. It is not very intense, in fact I would say it feels blunt. It required a little extra lube to get going also. Although there was some variation within the different chambers, it wasn’t all that stimulating. I would say that Danger is better for longer sessions as it isn’t so intense. It is not the tightest sleeve but it is snug, and usually will cause an orgasm due to the tightness rather than stimulation. Cleanup isn’t very long, similar to most other sleeves, but it can take a while to dry because of the complex texture. I usually hang the sleeves on a towel rack to dry which does a great job.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Danger is a solid choice for a subtler, less intense sleeve while still feeling pretty satisfying.

I am only 11 cm (4.5 in) Only when I take the sleeve out of the case and then move it over my penis, I feel that everything around the penis will tighten even more. The recurring pattern of nodules and cones is a true bliss. I guarantee you, ninja orgasm will certainly surprise you when using this great toy. For anyone looking for a first fleshlight that is very close to the feeling of a real vagina. Then this is definitely a chance for you. Regarding the use of lubricants, if you want a long session, then you will have to use lubricants several times. <br/>\nCleaning is a bit more intense because of all the bumps and cones. Simply rinsing is really not enough. You really have to rub the inside a bit with your fingers to get rid of all the remains. <br/>\nThe drying time is also something that you must keep in mind. Because not much air can get through, it takes a while before it is completely dry.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>A great first sleeve that fits very closely with the feeling of a real vagina.

This first chamber is very stimulating which makes it a real pleasure to penetrate. I would say this FL tops most other FLs in penetration. But the second thing which makes the sleeve great is the main texture. It has many small knobs in different shapes which ensure a tingeling and intense experience. This stimulation isn't that intense like for example with Cream, it's also a looser sleeve, which makes it perfect for longer sessions, even if there is much going on inside. The orgasm feeling is amazing. Cleaning is also easy, there isn't a chamber which is too winding for water to evaporate. The only negative point about this sleeve is the noise. DAMN this sleeve is noisy as hell! There is a really loud sucking noise when you fucking it, so if you have thin walls your neighbar/parents/partner/children may hear something. But that's the only negative point about this FL.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>One of the best mid-intense sleeves you can buy.

It's louder if you take the cap off but with the cap on the only thing people would hear are your moans. 4) The sleeve is on the looser end of the scale - not necessarily a bad thing.

I thoroughly enjoy this sleeve and this is why I want to make this review my first one on this site.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets start with the lips, which are incredibly detailed and fun to look at, they are open enough to allow for easy one handed access no need to get your mouse hand sticky with lube. The lips do not rise high above the fleshlight so it isn't really perfect for grinding but the deep curved very detailed opening makes up for that granting a decent amount of teaseplay<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first section of the sleeve the honeycomb structure plus the nipple bowl work well together as the honeycomb gives a nice ripply feeling that gets tighter but still feels pretty meaty resulting in pulling back the foreskin if you are uncut, making that the bowl will stimulate not only the head but also the shaft when entering and going threw it which has a sandpaper like feeling but in a good way. If you like this section you can screw the cap tighter making the rest of the sleeve milder and it makes this section stand out. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2nd section is where it's at, 1 on 1 it might not be as intense as obsession but together with the rest of the sleeve it blows you away. it can be tricky to get the knobs in the right place though, it's magic one session it's different than the other, so experiment a bit with turning the sleeve ups down or angling the sleeve. but when the knobs are in the perfect place it will truly engulf your entire head and since it's in the middle of the sleeve you have to push threw it which creates a perfect vortex for your shaft and when pulling back out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 3rd section I can just get passed the 3 rings but can't really tell if I notice them in a session or if they are solely there to create the vortex. there is just so much stuff going on at the same time if you are this deep ins it and that is what makes this sleeve super intense everything working together stimulating your head and the entire shaft at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nother bits and bobs:<br/>\n<br/>\nLube use: I use h2o, works perfectly with this sleeve, I cant really last long in this sleeve so never had any trouble with lube.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoise: I would say normal, can get a quieter with cap closed and with it open it makes the classic sound, not stealthy but not obnoxiously loud either.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleaning and Drying: Both of them takes a bit extra time cause of the middle bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading my review, hopes this helps you, but do note that I don't own many of the popular sleeves.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Insatiable is a somewhat wider but hyper intense sleeve which has a lot going on at the same time. It's highly addicting you almost feel cheated after having a great orgasm cause you've lost that amazing feeling, it surely leaves you wanting for more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's my favorite sleeve even though I normally prefer edging which is impossible in this one.

There's a lot to love here, so I'll do my best to unpack and describe this busy texture! You'll first be greeted by a lovely tight bubble butt with cheeks that invite and guide you in. There's also a decent amount of oriface detail which I appreciate. The penetration sensation is tight but has slightly gives way right after the entry, so things don't get too uncomfortable. The first few inches of the sleeve have a ribbed texture that provides a nice gentle massage. After that, this sleeve gets crazy. The middle of the sleeve features two rings of nubs surrounding a short series of tight ridges. I was taken by surprise when I first used this sleeve because it really feels like you're penetrating another hole within the sleeve. The feeling is further pronounced with the cap tightened, and you can actually hear a sort of slurping sound as you pass through the middle section. I can reach just the first part of the last section, but it is a consistent array of nubs that really stimulate your head after you've just popped through the middle 'hole'. This sleeve gets really intense, but the uniqueness of it is special and it provides really strong orgasms.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Long story short, this should be at the top of your shortlist if you're looking for an excellent Fleshjack.

Now onto the review!</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nRose is a pretty mild sleeve all around. The one thing that it does better than any other sleeve is provide a lotus node like sensation of popping through and penetrating each of its chambers. In spite of its lack of a traditional lotus node, these softer rounded ridges along the walls provide an even stronger sensation than any lotus node sleeve I’ve tried by far. Unfortunately the lack of other more textured chambers makes this just feel like 2 nice penetrations in a row followed by one extremely pronounced lotus node effect engulfing you but not much other stimulation to be had. If you really love lotus nodes than this could be a nice option and my first use provided an excellent experience where the sleeve had a truly novel sensation but it’s one note doesn’t offer quite enough for me to visit this sleeve very often after the initial excitement wore off. A little more variety in the chambers or some heavier texturing between nodes would have done this sleeve well to give it more stimulation and intensity but as it stands, there’s not quite enough going for it IMO.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>An overall mild sleeve with noticeably strong lotus node sensations throughout that are the only source of stimulation provided. If you want to experience what a lotus node at its best can feel like or are already in love with them and don’t mind the lack of other textures along with it than this might be worth looking at. I’d say it’s a good enough sleeve but definitely wouldn’t be near the top of my personal recommendation list.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"March 16th, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mccal100",reviewer:"Mccal100",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_2212f36b-2edf-47a5-87c7-53557e90b92a_grande.jpg?v=1617900762","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_b15b8786-b419-491d-99c1-cc1b020cb1a0_grande.jpg?v=1617900762","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_838afb19-cec7-40ea-af17-0e4e8ca06df8_grande.jpg?v=1617900762","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_4620347a-76f5-4bc6-8c1a-2cd7f8df473a_grande.jpg?v=1617900762","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_3295a91c-67b4-4823-9233-77ce11d48124_grande.jpg?v=1617900762","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_5e4f7055-8b5e-42c0-9407-8f4cb16dc294_grande.jpg?v=1617900762"]},{name:"Siren",girl:"Anikka Albrite",url:"/en/texture/siren",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/siren.jpg",scores:[4.05,4.17,4.06,3.98,3.82,2.82,3.88,2.8,4.11,3.39,3.35,3.35,3.28,4.09],description:"Ass worshippers rejoice!

It is detailed very well though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you penetrate the orifice while the very first part (the outside) is looser than most butt orifices it narrows right away and has what looks like and feels like a lotus node right away and in all truth feels a lot like when you first enter for actual anal sex. You just kinda pop through which is awesome and should be part of more textures. I dare say a lotus node at the entrance should almost be a standard. It's followed by a lot of ridges and bumps in a small area and adds a lot of intensity pulling/tugging in multiple directions at once. then followed by a narrowing in the texture which gets really tight (the whole texture is fairly tight but this is even more so). When you get past this tight section you \"pop\" through into a wider section that has more bumps that remind of how the destroya feels towards it's entrance. The last part of the texture will be probably unreachable by most but it's only okay so they wont miss much. Finally the suction on this is unbelievable, out of all of my sleeves it has the highest amount.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>In short it's a really good texture for those looking for intensity and are not concerned about realism. This is one of the few textures that anything past what the average man can reach isn't really a loss since the best parts are the first 6 inches by far.

The beginning chamber, with its funneling outward shaped design, makes for a decent, semi-tight penetration before it widens to a loose circumference that remains for the rest of the sleeve. The spiraling nubs inside the funnel are definitely noticeable but, due to their softness and smooth shape, they don’t provide much intensity. The stimulation is definitely there though and these nubs provides a nice massaging spiral along the way into the next chamber. There’s a slight choke point between the funnel and the next area that can be noticed when passing through, but isn’t very tight like many other sleeves’ chamber transition points. The next area provides a bit of intensity in comparison to the nubs with it’s abstract geometric shaped design, similar to a looser version of the chamber found in the Emily Willis Squirt texture. The edges don’t protrude much but provide just enough resistance to catch the glans every so often for an added stimulus to the head. This area also has a slightly stronger effect on the shaft than the initial chamber and, with only a small ramp up in sensation overall, makes for a very smooth transition that doesn’t disrupt the flow of the sleeve. This is still a low-mid intensity area for the most part but in combination with the mid stimulation of the whole sleeve, there is enough to keep things interesting, though it’d be a tough sleeve to use for a quick finish.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Overall, lightning is a solid choice if you prefer lower intensity flights or like your sleeves on the looser side. There’s enough stimulation to keep things interesting but those who like some roughness to their sleeves might find this one to be too boring for their tastes.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"April 3rd, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mccal100",reviewer:"Mccal100",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_b3098369-b69d-41cf-a6a8-9c84a3deec5a_grande.jpg?v=1603075128","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_e5899acb-e467-4348-a80a-5ba81b119eba_grande.jpg?v=1603075132","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_15403ad1-a057-4722-9daa-c8f69075aac5_grande.jpg?v=1603075136","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_4e756379-588c-45c2-8f00-7a7509b69d8d_grande.jpg?v=1603075141","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_7595b46d-adff-4659-be1a-4249ab4d8c66_grande.jpg?v=1603075178","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_72e6f1ee-93fb-4db2-b2ee-5b9ecaf5ff9d_grande.jpg?v=1603075182"]},{name:"Boss Level",girl:"Mia Malkova",url:"/en/texture/boss-level",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/boss-level.jpg",scores:[3.71,3.83,4.12,4.16,4.07,3.77,2.55,3.57,4.03,3.51,3.38,3.79,3.56,4.07],description:"Mia Malkova’s new texture Boss Level will pull your cock into a fantasy world of constricting curves and lusty spirals. Every swerve of Mia’s tight ass is filled with caressing knobs designed to add sizzling sensations to every stroke. Boss Level gives any man desiring anal play an epic adventure with an intense finale.",review:"<div class=\"text\">\n<p>\nCloser to 10 being perfect, lower numbers being bad. I will probably never give a 10. I am 6 inches long and 6 inches around, for reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleanup: 7/10 (There isn't much variation or a lot really super sticking out like a tentacle within the texture itself, the texture itself when you clean it looks more like bumps than anything. The only thing bringing this down a bit is that the bumps do kind of grab onto cum so the cleanup is a bit longer but not by much. The tightness and smallness of the sleeve is also something that makes the dry time a bit longer for this one.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside feel: 9/10 (Obviously, this is just a Fleshlight so the outside feel in reality will mostly just feel like a giant flashlight. However, I will say like the Spice texture, this one has a nice big ass to push on when you fuck. The asshole shape, while not absolutely super tight, is a nice roundish shaped tight hole, as opposed to the Spice's more oval tight hole. It feels amazing on the outside, the asscheeks are big enough to press onto you, the asshole's got that tightness and niceness just like I said my Spice had in my previous review. These two anal sleeves for outside feel are the absolute top dogs in my experience with Fleshlight. Really really like the way they made everything about the outside of this sleeve..)<br/>\n<br/>\nInside feel: 9/10 (Well this texture is quite easy to explain, while the texture looks super interesting at the surface, there is really only two points of super intense feelings. The first point, like with most anal sleeves is at the entrance, and this like I said in the outside feel part, is a very nice feeling entrance. The hole is super tight and you can feel it the entire way, and the slight ridge pattern near the beginning of the hole seems to give the asshole some ability to have some give and act like a more realistic asshole. The second part is the little curve you see within it, and somehow it just feels like a secondary asshole in a sense. It basically is just another super tight point in the texture, when paired with how tight and stimulating the bumps are already, it is quite nice. I would say in terms of anal sleeves, it is on par with my Spice, if maybe a little better, but the idea that it might be better could just be a matter of opinion.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSound: 7/10 (Much louder than the Spice texture. I think because the Boss Level is so tight throughout the entire sleeve, and with the secondary point of tightness within the sleeve... the suction is quite high. It feels great, but with more suction means you have more noise generally. It's nothing bad but if you wanted a quieter sleeve I would go for the Spice if you want a quiet anal sleeve, but this is not THAT much louder, it just is louder.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDurability: 9/10 (Needless to say, this is a fleshlight made in the modern times, so this is built like a tank and will last many many years with the proper care. In terms of durability, one of the best options you can choose on the market are fleshlights for these type of toys. Worth it in this category by a mile.)<br/>\n<br/>\nStimulation: 9/10 (This is way more stimulating than the Spice is. The little bumps and tightness of the entire sleeve really just makes those bumps push down from all directions on your cock. Really awesome feeling, feels like fake anime girl asshole tight or something. The secondary tightness point really is a great part of this as well, it's not too far back being at about 5-6 inches. Overall probably my favorite feeling anal masturbation toy that I've ever had. Beats out Spice by a lot and it makes sense if you look at both textures side by side.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm: 9/10 (With the high suction, and the tightness of the entire thing... combined with that secondary tightness point I keep talking about... this will absolutely drain you when you orgasm. Really good, I mean it just makes sense that high suction and tightness would make you cum harder. While it is higher stimulation, I noticed that I lasted longer than say something like more varied in the texture design, like the Stoya Epic... but I think it found a good balance in having me last long enough to be good with it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRealism: 7/10 (I gotta be honest, I really doubt that the human body's asshole could be this tight, and also have a secondary point of tightness within itself like this sleeve does. Of course, it's a Fleshlight so it doesn't feel absolutely unrealistic either. But I would say that if you really only care about realism, that you should check out the Stoya Epic, or Spice even. This one, isn't 100% realistic, but I would say that it is more of a \"fun\" take on an asshole and assfucking. The Boss Level in a way is like what some guys WANT anal to be like. But like I said in other reviews, real anal really feels more open on the inside, and the Boss Level is just super super tight.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFantasy: 9/10 (Well the fantasy I had with this, from how they advertised it: the name is Boss Level, so it's supposed to be hard to last a long time, and it's supposed to be really highly intensely hard to survive... like boss levels in video games haha. Needless to say, that fantasy wasn't really accurate, I can't last LONG but I don't cum really fast like I do with Epic. Not that it's a bad thing. Okay, so the next fantasy would be the anal fantasy right, well while not realistic, I think if you are looking for a totally unrealistic super tight asshole with a secondary point of tightness and just a nice stimulating bumpy texture throughout the rest of the sleeve... then THAT fantasy was absolutely met. I think that the fantasy most people will have with this, is just wanting to fuck an asshole, or fucking Mia Malkova's asshole. I do believe that those fantasies will be met with this sleeve, but just keep in mind that it is not THAT realistic, it's more just a fun design. I think if you were like me and wanted like a \"Boss Level\" hard to last long sleeve, a couple good options would be Go Surge, Destroya, Insatiable, Obsession, STU. Boss Level looks tough by looking at it, but the bark is worse than it's bite in terms of it being a hard to last in sleeve. Still going to give this a 9/10 because the fantasy for anal and a super tight anal experience was absolutely met and they didn't really market this as a stamina training type of thing anyway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPrice: 8/10 (With Fleshlight, and like many things, you get what you pay for. This is a great sleeve that will last you a long time with proper care and usage. With that knowledge, the price is quite good, and for having the realism it does along with the high stimulation and orgasm rating, with decent cleanup time, the price is absolutely fair. Of course, Fleshlight is expensive, but compared to some toys in the same category, you could be overpaying a lot more than a Fleshlight and get much worse quality.)\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>I'd say if you are looking for an unrealistic fantasy tight asshole, and don't mind a slightly longer dry time and a bit more noise than something like Spice... well then you will not be unhappy with this sleeve I don't think. Everyone is different, so your mileage may vary, but for me personally, this texture is freaking awesome. I am pretty damn happy with this purchase though, and while it might not be top in the rotation, I will probably use this quite a bit. I can see this type of sleeve improving with a breaking in period.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"March 17th, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/knife_bro69",reviewer:"knife_bro69",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_608c067d-8769-4290-abfe-5ff3ab2004e5_grande.jpg?v=1628691723","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_c3c5604e-cbab-4a1a-98fb-96e70f10b842_grande.jpg?v=1628691727","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_9628df47-5d12-4259-8884-c0f677bb1c77_grande.jpg?v=1628691730","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_d03e1588-b264-43d9-a1e1-1284326734cf_grande.jpg?v=1628691733","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_d3e0ad9a-4717-43d4-8e14-288425281262_grande.jpg?v=1628691736","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_2db498fb-3557-4b03-b1e5-dd7d0c2480a9_grande.jpg?v=1628691740"]},{name:"Tease",girl:"Tera Patrick",url:"/en/texture/tease",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/tease.jpg",scores:[3.71,3.93,4.09,3.89,3.63,3.1,3.96,3.12,4.04,3.37,3.5,3.35,3.21,4.06],description:"Tera's Tease Signature Texture begins with a ridiculously tight entrance tightly packed with ribbing and followed by an expansive chamber-like opening with gentle finger-like tentacles that massage you along as you enter into the next series of cavities.

Check out my profile if you’d like to see the rating scale/criteria I use and a bit of background info for more context. Now onto the review!</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nAsahole starts off with a nice penetration through a very tight opening leading into a chamber of staggered pillow squares that provide great stimulation and solid intensity on all parts of your shaft and head. The feeling on the glans is intense on the down stroke and on the shaft, when deeper in, provides a speed bump-esque type of sensation when gliding back and forth through them. This area is followed by a choke point filled with round bumps that squeezes the head as you break through to a mostly smooth section on the other side. The tightness of this area makes it so the bumps aren’t that noticeable, leaving only a subtle trace of the texture’s presence, as you push against the walls of the chamber and force them flat. It’s still a nice feeling of being strongly hugged and, for my size in particular, is perfect for my head to break through and allow my head to end up fully past this area and into the wider smooth section. The square bumps provide most of the pleasure from this sleeve and whether you focus on leaving your head in this area, allowing the glans to thrust over the contours and ridges these bumps provide or penetrate deeper and let them stimulate the shaft will determine the intensity of your flight. The swift increase in tightness that follows them is a great transition that keeps things very pleasurable and add variation to the sensations of the sleeve. If the squares start to become too stimulating on the more sensitive head, the smooth middle chamber makes for a nice way to calm things down while letting the pillow bumps give the shaft their attention.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>A great sleeve that can be used for any length of flight you’re in the mood for with a very stimulating beginning and a more mild/smoother second half</p>\n</div>',review_time:"March 20th, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mccal100",reviewer:"Mccal100",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/AsaAkira-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1506625404","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0000_FL_01605_H4A4392_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0001_FL_00570_H4A3478_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0002_FL_01340_H4A4127_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0003_FL_01866_H4A4523_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0004_FL_01679_DSC2177_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0005_FL_01117_H4A3977_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0006_FL_01230_DSC2096_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0007_FL_00375_H4A3264_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0008_FL_01962_H4A4619_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010"]},{name:"Storm",girl:"Romi Rain",url:"/en/texture/storm",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/storm.jpg",scores:[3.68,3.9,3.85,3.13,3.47,2.97,3.74,3.38,3.92,3.58,3.71,3.74,3.68,4.05],description:"Known for her explosive sexuality, Storm captures Romi's bold personality and stunning beauty in one magnificent package.

Those with sensitive members may also find this info helpful, as the effect is similar even if not 100% comparable. Whether due to girth or sensitivity, you don’t want textures that scrape badly. <br/>\n<br/>\nInfo for reference: just under 6” length, 7” shaft girth with a 5.5” head that’s fairly sensitive; all sessions done with sleeve flaps cut off (for looseness) + Fleshlight warmed &amp; locked down horizontally to thrust into (for better feeling sensations). If you’re girthy, but not 7” girthy, awesome – way more sleeves will work for you! Average these reviews with others, according to where on the girth spectrum you fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: if a sleeve works poorly for your girth due to the case allowing no more room to stretch, cutting a layer off the sleeve’s ring (that sits behind the case’s ring) can work wonders to reduce pressure and let you feel everything better. Just be careful of the sleeve falling out if used vertically, and always test out small adjustments before modding a sleeve any amount. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeeds girth mod: Maybe. It felt perfectly fine without modification, and after mod it got much less intense and aggressive. If you like strong sensations and your size stretches it out, don’t modify. <br/>\n<br/>\nSmoothness: 7/10. Though the texture is complicated, it’s fairly wide, and doesn’t scrape as badly as one might think. Even smoother after modification. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: 8/10. The sleeve’s intensity wasn’t in a “strong rubbing that’s hard to handle” way, but rather a “so nice it’s hard to hold out” way. After modification, it became unexpectedly mellow, and better for longer, slower sessions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSensation: 8/10. It’s an incredibly active sleeve, but everything blends together quite a bit. Mostly just soft and squishy, and depending on how tight it is on you, you’ll feel different sections more or less. Where it really shines is when you’re extra sensitive and swollen up, either from extreme arousal or being close to orgasm, where it gets much more pleasurable and distinct. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity During Orgasm: 7/10. It’s a lot to rub against you, so if you’re sensitive while finishing, it probably isn’t a good sleeve to stroke through.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Overall Experience: 8/10. All around, a great edging sleeve that’s perfect for long sessions and hard pounding.

I have used all reviewed sleeves at least 10 times prior to review.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nI have four other anal sleeves; Shameless, Cupcake, Boss level, and Tight Chicks. Ahegao is a fantastic anal sleeve, and holds up well against the others. the exterior is different from the others, and has much larger 'cheeks' that you can feel as you use it. Compared to something like tight chicks or cupcake, which are practically flat by comparison, this sleeve really feels like you're going between something rather than just straight into a hole. The orifice itself is pleasant to look at and penetration is fantastic. The interior is very tight with a very stimulating texture throughout. While there isn't as much variation as some other sleeves, the repeating pattern is rotated as you go deeper, and every inch feels new.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Very good anal sleeve.

This is one of the smoothest fleshlights I've used. It is not very intense and for that reason I strapped it into the launch and had a nice long session with it. It was great just sitting back watching porn and occasionally pressing a button to change up the length or speed until all the sudden I could feel myself about to cum and just making it go to town on myself.

An Epic adventure awaits you.",review:'<div class="text">\n<p>\nHello everyone, very very recently, I tried out my first FL. Needless to say, it’s way better than my hand by massive amounts. Of course, it’s not going to beat the real thing, but I never expected it to, that said, it does have pretty realistic qualities to it that makes it feel like sex in enough ways for me not to care that it isn’t the real deal. To give some background, I have had sex a lot in my life, currently am engaged, and the average amount of times I have sex a week is about 2-4 times a week, I have an extremely high sex drive and I masturbate almost everyday because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose the epic texture as my first sleeve, mostly because I like stoya and I like anal, pretty simple choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nEntryway<br/>\n<br/>\nThe asshole was one of the main reasons I chose this, it is tight, the texture is kind of aggressive, and it does a pretty good job of replicating what an actual asshole feels like. It clenches down on your shaft and you can feel the asshole gripping you throughout your usage. I was worried it would get a bit loose because of the shape of the asshole, and that might still be the case, but it is still like day one after multiple uses.<br/>\n<br/>\nTexture<br/>\n<br/>\nThe inside is pretty great, in the texture picture you can see that there are ribbed sections at the beginning and end of the FL. The beginning is tight and grips on your dick simulating a tight girls asshole. Id say it’s pretty darn realistic, and I do love anal quite a lot. It isn’t super intense, or overly tight, but Id say just replicates an asshole very well. The bumps and ribs in the texture also drain your cock very quickly, which is amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleanup/Drying<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this being my first FL, I had to look up the proper steps to do this stuff. Ive seen box fans and other setups to dry out the FL, but personally I just put it in the sink with no soap, cold water, air dry, sanitize, and powder. Has gotten to top shape every time so far. This was something I was always concerned with going into this hobby, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it cleaned quite easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nBullet Points<br/>\n<br/>\nTightness: Pretty tight but not insanely so, tightness is like the real thing, maybe tighter because the sleeve has multiple rib areas and grip points while real assholes really can only grip you at the butthole.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasms: pretty intense but nothing super out of the ordinary, compared to normal sex that is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmell: Not really any smell. It’s a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: Id say above average to average intensity, I can last a good amount of time with it, but also I last way less than I expected to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther: The texture does change quite rapidly compared to other textures that Ive seen. I quite enjoy it but it might be something you dont enjoy.<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Final:<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate giving number scores for opinions about things, so I wont. If my FL broke for some reason, Id buy another without hesitation. The epic texture makes me very happy and does satisfy my desires for anal without having the real thing. I think it’s probably in the middle of the road in terms of FL stats, but it’s traits of the asshole being super pleasurable and the inside textures having many layers to it, combines to create a great ass fucking experience.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"February 12th, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/knife_bro69",reviewer:"knife_bro69",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Stoya-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1594154863","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Stoya-Gallery2_grande.jpg?v=1594154863","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Stoya-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1594154863","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Stoya-Gallery4_grande.jpg?v=1594154863","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Stoya-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1594154863","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Stoya-Gallery6_grande.jpg?v=1594154863"]},{name:"Fuego",girl:"Nikki Delano",url:"/en/texture/fuego",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/fuego.jpg",scores:[3.49,3.67,3.74,3.34,3.7,3.4,3.59,3.48,3.94,3.15,3.42,3.6,3.5,4.03],description:"You aren't ready for the Nikki Delano lady sleeve featuring the unique Fuego texture - but you're going to have a literal blast trying it out! You'll start out with a wavy entry point and pleasure bead, followed immediately by intensity ridges. If you can survive the first chamber without blowing your load, the middle section with overlapping ridges and strands might do the trick. If not, the final chamber will do the trick. It features a waffle design of alternating areas of tightness that will lead to sensation overload!",review:'<div class="text">\n<p>\nI\'m am of average length and girth. After numerous enjoyable "flights" here is my review of the Fuego sleeve:<br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: I would rate this as moderately-high, probably leaning closer to high. As you pump away in this sleeve, the sensations seem to creep up rather quickly and are quite noticeable. This was definitely the case with my first use. But even after breaking it in, the sensations still built up quite well and the textures inside just seemed to know the right spots to stimulate (more on that soon). Best way I could describe this feeling is that this sleeve was just as excited to be played with as I was to use it!<br/>\n<br/>\nStimulation: The texture and its variations here truly shine in this sleeve. The pleasure bead at the start and the ridges soon afterwards seem to playfully tantalize you as you enter, while the sleeve sucks you in (which is further enhanced by the lotus node partway into the sleeve). When I first used the sleeve, I was surprised at how tight it felt. Out of all the sleeves I own, this felt like the tightest one out of the bunch. It began to loosen a little bit after a few uses, but still quite noticable.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery chamber of this sleeve feels stimulating (I can\'t comment on the very last chamber unfortunately). From the wonderful ridges at the start to the mid-section crosshatch-like ridges, you will enjoy the lush sensations generously given to you by this sleeve. Just basking in its textures when you reach that "edging high" is one of the best feelings ever. The feeling of the varied texture pushes your arousal levels quite quickly. Those who are new to FL\'s should keep this in mind if this is your first or early sleeve in your potentially growing collection.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall flight and orgasm experience: The sleeve\'s varied and stimulating textures, noticeable tightness, and grip-like suction make for a truly pleasurable flight. Thus the orgasms in this sleeve have that "oomph" that is missing in a less-intense sleeve like True Lust. Riding the sensations as you get closer to the edge feels heavenly. Enjoying the "edging high" by stroking slowly as I felt the ripples and ridges of the sleeve\'s texture is probably one of my most memorable experiences with FL\'s in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nSide notes:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sleeve is a bit noisy, so consider this if you happen to have other people in your residence and you don\'t want them to know your "business".<br/>\n<br/>\nVaried textures like this are usually a bit more time-consuming to clean and Fuego is no exception. Be sure to take time in cleaning the sleeve and dig inside to make sure that no remaining signs of your flight are remaining in the nooks and crannies of the texture.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen drying, the sleeve tends to still hold some water inside, so use a small microfiber towel to assist with the drying. I used one that is wrapped around a stick so I can just "brush" inside the sleeve. You can find these online for cheap.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Fuego is a keeper and definitely a sleeve to have in your collection. If you like moderately-high to high intensity sleeves with varied textures along with a nice gripping sensation and suction, then this is definitely the sleeve for you. New Flyers may want to consider things like the noise level, cleaning, and intensity if you are thinking of making this your first purchase. But if you plan on expanding your budding collection, this should definitely be on your list.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"October 20th, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mangowango",reviewer:"MangoWango",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_244e4fd4-4171-44c1-a6e0-d6f26f0c1941_grande.jpg?v=1597413224","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_e3c1e444-d3ef-4881-8f0c-9a9db016b308_grande.jpg?v=1597413229","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_64f2b546-d116-4fd4-8f51-a64e3378f6d6_grande.jpg?v=1597413236","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_b4f7bb0a-c456-4366-b62f-12c29188a35f_grande.jpg?v=1597413246","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_e0a30ccf-100c-401e-9cf3-668b73830690_grande.jpg?v=1597413252","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_cbece8be-fcec-4cbb-8582-7d3b829669e8_grande.jpg?v=1597413257"]},{name:"Eden",girl:"Janice Griffith",url:"/en/texture/eden",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/eden.jpg",scores:[3.3,3.61,3.62,3.44,3.57,3.6,3.32,3.66,3.99,3.5,3.47,3.62,3.29,4],description:"Eden is the first Fleshlight to be released with a new and beautiful medium toned Fleshskin sleeve. Matching Janice’s pussy perfectly, this lifelike stroker is as tight as the petite star herself. Featuring a combination of highly arousing pleasure points within its chamber, Eden envelops your penis with mind-blowing rings and shafts that will leave you begging for more.",review:"<div class=\"text\">\n<p>\nWhen I first got into Fleshlights back in 2014/15 one of the downsides to them was most of the porn stars on there I didn't know or care for outside of Stoya and it remained that way. I would only really get the Fleshlight for the sleeve more than the star itself. Janice Griffith was the other way around as she has been one of my favourites for awhile and when I discovered she now had her own I had to have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally I tend to buy FLs that are specifically tighter and/or intense but this one looked it it may be more mild but again I got it for Janice. This is the very first time I have reviewed a FL so take that for what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had this sleeve for about 2 years now and I have gotten a lot of use of it. At this time I have 5 FLs and I rotate them through from least to favourite unless I really feel like I need to have a mind blowing experience. Janice's Eden is probably one the bottom end of the 5 right now, not last place but 4th sometimes 3rd in rotation. That does not entirely mean it is a bad FL though, after reading a few reviews I actually sort of love it for the reasons some may not like it. The biggest reason its on the lower end of my rotation but one I still still enjoy is because I get something out of it the others don't give me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is definitely not an intense FL however some have said it is loose which I think is entirely accurate. Eden doesn't grip you like other FLs that specifically do but, this one for a lack of a better word tickles and rubs in a soft gentle-ish fashion. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe entry point which to be honest is my favourite part of Eden, it's not specifically tight but its small nubs again tickle and graze my head in a very pleasing fashion. It's not like other entry point or at least the ones I am used to where its tight right off the bat. It gently contours to my head but not squeezing it. One of the things I do when I start is I tend to just have my head play around the entry point of the sleeve to replicate getting a BJ (I am fairly sure others do this) and of the 5 FLs I have this one is the most pleasurable for this. It replicated a nice easy BJ and getting starts getting me aroused.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second part is weakest part and where I think every is getting the loose feeling from. I agree of what my penis can reach in this sleeve this part is my least favourite but even still I can still sort of appreciate how it lightly glazes my head and rubs my shaft. I feel it gently which is pleasurable but I do feel somewhat disappointed in that when I need this sleeve to be tighter it doesn't matter if the cap is on air tight this part is still too gentle when I am building to climax. Its great in a slow build but if you really want to get a good pace going or want to up the intensity this part of the sleeve will let you down.<br/>\n<br/>\n3rd part is to lotus node followed by the tight block entry which is easily the 2nd best of the 3 spots I can hit. There is a reason you often find a lotus node somewhere in many FLs and it often provides a nice sensation. It feels nice going as deep as I can to reach this one when I am finally going full stroke.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my experience to get the most of this FL hard and deep tends the be the best way to get good pleasure out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf my 5 FLs the is the best one for edging, just keeping yourself pleasured but not quite hitting climax unless you really go at it, some may find it boring because they want the FL to work your into the climax and while this one can I feel this one is more relax and enjoy the ride for awhile kind of flight. To be honest of the 5 FLs I have this one is the most realistic to a real vagina, of course everyone and their package is different but to me this one is the realistic that I have had in the over dozen FLs I have owned since 2014.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>This is what I would call a chill FL. If you are looking for a tight and intense flight you are not going to get it with this one like you would get with others here. I am not sure it was built to be exactly that. While I love tight and intense FLs I do not regret having this one because some times I like to have some variety in the mix not just FLs that grip me like a vice. It's like our favourite food we may love it but probably not every day. Sometimes I just like a smooth, gentle, chill flight where I can take my time, let this sleeve's gentle and smooth touches slowly work me into a great climax and I have usually had pretty good climaxes from this one. If that sounds like the kind flight you want to be on then give this one a shot or two or a whole lot like me because I love Janice.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"July 23rd, 2023",reviewer_url:"/en/u/yellowdog",reviewer:"YellowDog",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_a7ff6103-3d57-4f71-9e59-1fb171e0ca8c_grande.jpg?v=1614698395","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_cb3236ff-46ae-4b1d-b95c-6eece2928b39_grande.jpg?v=1614698401","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_314715c2-63aa-4e98-ac05-c24da3fb1312_grande.jpg?v=1614698404","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_fc1d5230-bec2-4a6b-afcb-8b7546beadf4_grande.jpg?v=1614698409","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_1e961b31-0c2a-4230-8697-4aef471e5061_grande.jpg?v=1614698413","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_fcb5f7c9-3daf-450a-b115-6b48f676eeb5_grande.jpg?v=1614698417"]},{name:"Thrust",girl:"",url:"/en/texture/thrust",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/thrust.jpg",scores:[3.66,3.95,3.7,2.93,3.92,3.52,3.45,3.22,4.02,2.29,3.13,3.05,2.96,4.01],description:"The Fleshlight Turbo™ offers you the most realistic and satisfying alternative to oral sex.

Not a collector - I keep my drawer small, only have room for the best, &amp; trash the rest!</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nUNDERRATED! This one has been on my list to try for a really long time just because of how unique and appealing the texture looked to me. Huge soft nodules massaging my dick gradually getting tighter and tighter? Yes, please. It delivers on a unique massaging feel, with a bit of a constriction point towards the end. It's actually gotten better and better with time and use, and its now creeping up on my top 3. I'd say this is a commonly overlooked sleeve that, if appeals to you, shouldn't be slept on.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally versatile, feels good cap on OR off which can't be said for every sleeve. Cap off the nubs still grip and stimulate pretty closeley. Cap on, with enough lube, is typically a very consistent experience until lube starts drying up and it creates way too much suction. <br/>\n<br/>\nPretty much the perfect amount of tightness. Not too tight that everything becomes imperceptible, tight enough that you feel a good satisfying squeeze, especially towards the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nEntrance is probably one of the best I've felt in any FL. It doesn't look it, but somehow the entrance itself provides a nice constricting squeeze and something to pop through right off the bat as you enter. Very unique and feels somewhat realistic actually - like the girl is really clamping down on her kegels. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe heavy bumps are immediately perceptible. The rest of the sleeve has a same-y vibe with the nubs from each section not really feeling all that different from eachother, but there is a noticable difference in tightness, and there is a noticeable point of constriction towards the 5-6\" mark that is perceptible maybe only half the time, but incredible when it is. Overall past the squeeze at the entrance and the change in tightness toward the back, its a mild massager, but one that really does hit he mark with realism and sensation. It has something about it that keeps me coming back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really expected the nubs to be more pronounced and distinguishable, especially because of the unique way the texture is designed, the nubs should be \"in the way\" of your dick as you slide in but that effect really isn't perceptible. It just feels like a somewhat lumpy, soft pussy, which is great, but thats really it. Nothing extra going on at all. Going slow it definitely has some very realistic qualities that I really liked. Thrusting hard, it tends to produce a teeeeny bit of artificial feelings as you notice the patterns of the texture but they are still good. <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall very solid, underrated sleeve.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>If you love tight squeeze entrances but still want a perceptible massage inside, or If you've got above average length and want a middle intensity sleeve that's on the realistic side - like a soft, lumpy, supple, stretchy pussy - this is a great bet!</p>\n</div>",review_time:"May 27th, 2023",reviewer_url:"/en/u/bonahole",reviewer:"Bonahole",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Bigfoot",girl:"",url:"/en/texture/bigfoot",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/bigfoot.jpg",scores:[3.34,3.72,3.77,3.08,3.32,2.89,2.13,3.42,3.84,3.24,3.35,3.67,3.32,4.01],description:"Perhaps this is proof that Bigfoot does exist.

I have a banana penis (more like a ski jump as my curvature is quite severe). I also have a setup so I can either simulate missionary or doggy style (so no hands to enhance the experience and it really does). I use a texture at least 3 times before I write a review. Often times I line up 3-5 textures for same time comparison or just plain fun. I always warm my textures before usage. I tend to use a combination of lube a saliva, because the saliva tends to add a bit more realism for me. My favorite lube is Climax Bursts.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nI love ridges, so I got this as it looked much like the Dragon. I was not wrong. First thing, the butt cheeks were definitely more protruding than any other butt sleeve (and that's a plus for me). It was exciting to see my penis part those cheeks. It really adds to the experience. I started with minimal lube and the cap half tight. The pop upon entry wasn't that great but then it is not tight, which I like. The spacing of the chambers to allow relief from the ridges was wonderful. Just as you stroke in and are feeling aroused, you get a break, push in deeper and now your frenulum and shaft get pulled back and massaged. Oh what a feeling. I was louder than the sleeve, because of my pleasure from the thrusting. The ridges were less intense than Dragon, but the chamber size variation made for a pulsating experience that I did not feel in Dragon. This is a great sleeve for edging (for me anyway). I used this sleeve doggy style so I could really thrust. As with the Dragon, my orgasm was draining.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>If you like ridges, then this sleeve should be on your list. If you don't like tightness then this sleeve is for you too. This was a good purchase. Just the visual of the butt cheeks alone gets me started. </p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 1st, 2023",reviewer_url:"/en/u/fishmann",reviewer:"fishmann",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_244e4fd4-4171-44c1-a6e0-d6f26f0c1941_grande.jpg?v=1597413224","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_e3c1e444-d3ef-4881-8f0c-9a9db016b308_grande.jpg?v=1597413229","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_64f2b546-d116-4fd4-8f51-a64e3378f6d6_grande.jpg?v=1597413236","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_b4f7bb0a-c456-4366-b62f-12c29188a35f_grande.jpg?v=1597413246","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_e0a30ccf-100c-401e-9cf3-668b73830690_grande.jpg?v=1597413252","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_cbece8be-fcec-4cbb-8582-7d3b829669e8_grande.jpg?v=1597413257"]},{name:"Destroya",girl:"Stoya",url:"/en/texture/destroya",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/destroya.jpg",scores:[4.18,4.05,3.67,3.48,3.42,2.48,3.69,2.65,4.01,3.29,3.22,3.05,2.84,3.99],description:"Upon entry, three small rings of bumps will grasp you tightly, followed by the ultra piercing pleasure dome that will give you 360 degrees of unmatched bliss.

Most of my reviews reference how that review FLight was accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to the review for the: Esperanza Gomez Mamacita!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow I got it: I bought this in May 2023 alongside the Amante FL of Esperanza Gomez. Since May is her birth month, Fleshlight was running a code to reduce the price of birthday FLGs, and given her sleeves aren't available except as a full FL product (sleeve and case), this was a excellent opportunity to buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAesthetics: The mold of Esperanza Gomez's rear entry is quite realistic, and you can even see a section of her vulva below her butthole. It may only be a replica of the real thing, but it gives you plenty to think about the real thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLube: As mentioned in the intro, I use Gun Oil H2O, which is a water-based lubricant. DO NOT USE the original silicone variant of lube or any silicone or oil lube. Because the sleeve texture does have various crevices, you may need more.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoise: If you unscrew the cap slightly, the Mamacita does emit some noise, but unless you are FLying with your room open or someone actually in the room, it's probably not audible outside the room. <br/>\n<br/>\nPenetration: As I entered the Mamacita and pushed through the entry, I got a pleasant, but not overwhelming sensation from the various nubs and peaks of the sleeve. I could tell they were there, and the feeling was nice. As I finished penetrating, I began to pull back, and the sensation was a little stronger, especially as the underneath of the head of my cock received stimulation, which was delightful, and was ever so encouraging to slide back in again, and repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: Some sleeves are rather mild, and some are very intense. The Mamacita is really delightful as it starts off at a moderate intensity, and tends to stay there, only building intensity based on how hard and fast you thrust. This is actually a sleeve you can last in if you wanted to, or you can go hard and fast and cum quickly. Throughout the FLight, I felt like I was mostly in control, and could take my time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, I feel that FLG sleeves have a bit of \"character\" that takes after their FLG counterpart, and the Mamacita has me further convinced this is the case. Esperanza Gomez seems to be someone who has seen and done it all, and wants you to enjoy yourself how you want to. You want a quick romp? You can. You want to take your time and enjoy the FLight? You can.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, nothing lasts forever. The intensity does build. This sleeve is patient, but there's a goal in sight. Eventually, the intensity builds to a point where it's time to release, and best to not keep waiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm: With a FL, there are three orgasms that tend to come about (pun intended). One is a gentle buildup that leads to a nice orgasm. Another is one that causes you to cum without warning. The last is a \"when you blow, you know.\" The Mamacita has a character of mostly the first (if you take your time) and a little of the third (you will know when you blow). The release was great, and there was even a small amount of vocalization as well. The end result was fantastic, and one I'd love to repeat over and over again. <br/>\n<br/>\nCleanup: A good steady stream of warm/hot water will easily remove all of the lube and aftermath, but do take some time, and make sure you clear any crevices within the texture. Consider running the stream of water through both ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you have the Fleshlight AIR, drying is a breeze. Dry the outer sleeve and the case, put the sleeve back in the case, with neither lid on and screw in the FL to the AIR and turn the AIR on. Given the varied textures of the Mamacita, I'd go for three presses of the on button (60 minutes) to ensure your sleeve is totally dry. Unscrew from AIR, recap the FL and it's ready to go again. If you don't have a AIR, Paper Towels (and quality paper towels, not store brand economy towels) are your next best friend. Run them through the canal a few times (be careful not to tear them). Then leave out in open air to dry (if you need to conceal the sleeve, stick in a old (but clean) t-shirt loosely to allow air to vent.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>The Mamacita is a excellent, well-rounded (pun intended) sleeve. It offers FLyers of all types something they may want. Those interested in quick sessions will enjoy just the same as those who are willing to put in the effort and take their time. It's a worthwhile buy, especially for those who are only looking to pick up just a few FLs and are looking for maximum utility with each. </p>\n</div>",review_time:"May 24th, 2023",reviewer_url:"/en/u/revtwentyseven",reviewer:"revtwentyseven",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery2_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery4_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery6_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery7_grande.jpg?v=1679275777","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/EsperanzaGomez-Gallery8_grande.jpg?v=1679275777"]},{name:"True Lust",girl:"Kendra Lust",url:"/en/texture/true-lust",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/true-lust.jpg",scores:[3.15,3.66,3.58,3.02,3.39,3.3,3.08,3.69,3.84,3.43,3.58,3.8,3.6,3.97],description:"Kendra’s sensational True Lust is a unique and authentic texture.

Tight Chicks is a dick-warming journey with many happy endings.",review:'<div class="text">\n<p>\nI have let myself use this four times now so I feel I can give a decent first impression. To preface, any review I ever give is always going to be unbiased in regards to the porn star Because I only buy my toys for overall texture and practical usage. To be honest, 98% of the girls fleshlight chooses to “replicate” are not remotely my type and if I was to focus on them, it would be difficult to orgasm or even maintain an erection. All this is to say, when I talk talk about fleshlights, there is no glossy nostalgia tied to it. It feels how it feels, and that’s it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor reference, I’m a grower not a shower so I’ll just give you my average stats. 8 long, 6 girth. Fleshlights I own for comparison are, *Anal*: Punk, Texas tornado, Sinner, Shameless, Forbidden, and now Tight Chicks. *Vaginal*: Obsession, Destroya, Indulge, Bump N’ Grind, Outlaw, Pink Lady.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is definitely an interesting and I would say rather complex fleshlight. Some things I loved, others not so much. It has like ... layers of sensation, even with the mono texture. The entrance is tight, but not as tight as sinner or even as tight as shameless. Still, there is a pleasant pop when you enter, even if it didnt Wow me. It has ... low cheeks. Meaning, there isn’t much “ass” to cushion your groin. That makes for more balls deep ballsdeepiness but less overall enjoyment from the impact of my thrusts, and since its all one texture I don’t care how balls deep I go in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce inside though, it’s a different story entirely. Something about the inside of this toy was, almost magical to me. It’s crowded in there. For me, it is one of the softest, smoothest, but also ingeniously textured fleshlights I’ve ever felt. The textures don’t hit you separately so much as they do in one big harmony. It’s like hundreds of fresh play-dough people were all waiting for me to stick my dick in their village and they all just begin massaging me with swift, clear, whooshing motions. Is that a fantasy of mine? No, it’s honestly terrifying, but I’m trying to make a point here.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though its a one note texture, the note it provides is extremely soothing, inviting, disarming and just stimulating enough. I think it is a fantastic edging fleshlight, and one that is probably felt best when you go a bit slower with it while increasing the cap suction. When I go too deep too fast, I kind of lose feeling of much of the texture due to my girth, it’s crowded inner tightness, and it’s continuous one note presentation, but it may just require more breaking in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s unique, and may have mysteries that still need unearthed, but right NOW it is not my FAVORITE fleshlight. My top three are a tie between sinner &amp; shameless for 1st and 2nd place, and now I have a tie for 3rd and 4th place between punk, and tight chicks. Punk and tight chicks are polar opposite‘s in terms of intensity and method of stimulation, but they both feel uniquely wonderful in their own right. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>I think it is a good purchase.

Explore and experience Madison Ivy's anal aptitude with this Fleshlight.",review:"<div class=\"text\">\n<p>\nI'll start by saying I'm not a Madison Ivy fanboy. She has one epic scene in Schoolbus girls that everybody should have a copy of, but I don't specifically look for her scenes and the fact that it's her butt had nothing to do with my purchase. I feel that's important to note because fans of certain stars can overrate their sleeves because it belongs to her. Not the case here. <br/>\n<br/>\nHer actual butt mold is about average. What makes a great butt and what makes a great butt mold are two different things. I think my hands would be all over Madison's ass long before they'd be all over Joanna Angel's ass, but Joanna has a better ass mold. Madison's butthole is about as tight as they come, though. I checked. You can stick a toothpick in there and hold the sleeve by the tail and it will hold onto the toothpick by itself. It's not too tight that it becomes an issue. I hate the pink butt because it always seems to rub me wrong no matter how much lube I use. Not an issue here. You won't be doing any special tricks on entry, though. It can be a little tough performing initial penetration. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe texture reminds me, and is definitely related to, the heartthrob texture. They aren't similar enough that owning one should exclude you from owning the other, though. Take the large bumps in heartthrob and elongate them. Now make the ridges in it more pronounced and you have Wonderland. Those bumps in heartthrob make it one of the more unrealistic sleeves. This variation in Wonderland makes it one of the more realistic ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I think Wonderland excels and what makes it unique is that it has an above average realism and intensity. Usually those two are opposites and as one goes up, the other goes down. Properly warmed and with a warm lube, this thing is better than a real ass. The total package makes actual sex better, but the texture itself is very close to an actual ass only better. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbove average tightness after initial penetration. As I said before, the orifice is tight as can be, but after that it opens up to a nice width that I call about as tight as a normal user would want it. It may be a little tight for some, but those folks are the minority. Sometimes the tightness can hide the texture. The ridges are pronounced enough in this that it doesn't happen here. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe closest I can come to a negative is the space between the long bumps. They expand in thickness during them and therefore get thinner between them. These spaces are small and don't effect the texture or feeling, but they are a little thin. I clean with extra care. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe all important question I think should be asked every time: If something happened to this sleeve, would I buy it again? YUP!!! I think it's a hidden gem. Either popular sleeves are just popular because we believe what we read and spread it as truth whether it is or not making those sleeves popular while ignoring ones that are just as good or better because we don't hear enough about them or 100 guys with the exact same size and shape penis can feel the exact same texture differently. I think it's a little bit of both. I think about 70-80% of guys feel the texture one way with the remainder feeling it either stronger or weaker. Maybe I'm in the minority who thinks this sleeve is great. But it's currently my pick for the most underrated sleeve in my collection.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Looking for a sleeve with above average realism and intensity that's on the tighter side?

Most of my reviews reference how that review FLight was accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to the review for the Candy texture, the exclusive texture to Ella Hughes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow I got it: I won this particular FL as part of the giveaway on FleshAssist after the 2019 winter giveaway. Although I have already rated this sleeve some time ago, I never got around to posting the review. Although it was a \"freebie\" via contest, I shall endeavor to give this a fair review.<br/>\n<br/>\nAesthetics: Like all FL girls, the front of the sleeve is molded after the vulva of the star in question, this case Ella Hughes. The vulva is quite appealing visually, both in use and when in display. Some people find aesthetics part of the experience, some do not. In some of my FLights, aesthetics do sometimes provide mental stimulation. I can't say that I enjoyed the visual penetration more than other sleeves, but it definitely didn't turn me off, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nLube: As mentioned in the intro, I use Gun Oil H2O, which is a water-based lubricant. DO NOT USE the original silicone variant of lube or any silicone or oil lube. I needed only a bit of lube in the opening (and spread about with a finger) and some lube on the penis and that was pretty much it and for this FLight did not need extra lube.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoise: I did loosen the cap just slightly to facilitate better thrusting, but this did not impact sound in any way. It's not super loud, but unless you are going to town and someone is either in the room or the door is open, highly unlikely one's going to hear what you're up to. You might get a bit of a \"whooshing\" sound if you do thrust fairly quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nPenetration: Penetrating the Candy texture was quite enjoyable. When initially thrusting in, you have some waves that are an antechamber to the main even, a set of ramps that encourage you to push in further into some triangular rounded nubs that even the average endowed man in girth would enjoy. The end triangular ridges though are probably out of reach for most men unless the enter through the opposite end of the sleeve. Pulling back, you'll feel those ramps offering slight but noticeable resistance as to encourage you to push back in. As I made my initial thrusts into the Candy, I did notice this, and it definitely helps to build up the intensity, I felt I wanted more. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: Admittedly, FL might have been a little enthusiastic about potentially blowing on contact with the sleeve. The sleeve wasn't all that intense to begin with, but those guiding ramps after the waves do begin to exert additional stimulation as you continue to thrust in and out. As I continued to thrust, I could feel the wave, ramp and triangle textures on the glans and shaft more and more, encouraging me to a full erection and increased sensations while FLying. Of course, that's also a classic sign of closing in on the finish line. One could potentially slow down, and build up the sensation even more, but after a couple days lull without a FLight... I wanted to go for it, and this sleeve will be all too happy to let you do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm: With a FL, there are three orgasms that tend to come about (pun intended). One is a gentle buildup that leads to a nice orgasm. Another is one that causes you to cum without warning. The last is a \"when you blow, you know.\" The Candy is very much the last result. Even if you build up, you will know when you cum. The release was enjoyable, complete and even resulted in that satisfactory feeling of accomplishment. Also, I had a feeling that all the preparation and effort was worthwhile. Even after multiple FLights, I've never seemed to have a bad one with the Candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleanup: While this sleeve does have some decent textures to it, it's also fairly spacious, so running a good, warm steady stream of water ought to wash through most deposits. Run water through both openings to really make sure it's clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, I did acquire the Fleshlight AIR, and it is a game changer. If you have the AIR, take the lids off, rinse out the sleeve and case, and dry the case in full plus the exterior of the sleeve. Put the sleeve back into the case but do not put the lids back on. Screw the FL into the AIR and turn the AIR on for 40 minutes (two pushes of the button). Unscrew the FL, recap the FL and it's ready to go again. If you don't have an AIR, the best way to help the drying process is with good quality paper towels. Use care running the towel through the canal. After it is mostly dry to dry (paper towels won't get it all dry), leave FL uncapped to allow air drying. If you need to conceal the sleeve, stick the sleeve and case in a old (but clean) t-shirt loosely to allow air to vent.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>The Candy is a excellent sleeve for those who are in the market for a fairly intense sleeve. It's not a top-tier sleeve, but a worthwhile purchase if one is looking for a little variety. Even if I didn't win this sleeve, I would still have eventually bought it. </p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 31st, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/revtwentyseven",reviewer:"revtwentyseven",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_1_6cdb4bd1-2009-44a3-a6f6-64f5fc1f1e36_grande.jpg?v=1577215028","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_2_ae34c12e-bbf0-4448-9e37-697cd39d2a75_grande.jpg?v=1577215028","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_3_454b2e2a-3ec0-4342-a2c4-515dd85fc3ac_grande.jpg?v=1577215028","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_4_8df05894-f9d2-4d87-a8ad-9fcc571f247e_grande.jpg?v=1577215028","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_5_a9954ce1-508b-45c8-802c-e421a2e0c0dd_grande.jpg?v=1577215029","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_6_4d441364-6854-4bc5-a532-c1626625b227_grande.jpg?v=1577215029"]},{name:"Swallow",girl:"Shared Texture",url:"/en/texture/swallow",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/swallow.jpg",scores:[3.6,3.93,3.69,3.45,4,3.8,3.05,3.37,3.97,3.14,3.46,3.75,3.53,3.94],description:"The most realistic oral sex experience in existence.

Check out my profile if you’d like to see the rating scale/criteria I use and a bit of background info for more context. Now onto the review!</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nEuphoria has 3 consistent chambers that fluctuate the tightness within them from tight to very tight. As I only reach the second chamber, the transitional choke point between the two is one of the more pronounced sensations in the sleeve for my glans when thrusting in and out. The first chamber’s bottom diamond structures provide a strong stimulation along the underside, particularly when gliding across the frenulum, which can actually start to become rough when lube dries up but is generally a very pleasant feeling otherwise and a needed bit or intensity to help keep the sleeve interesting during longer flights. The grid pattern is the only other featured texture and helps to add a constant stimulation around your whole member for the course of the flight that isn’t overly intense but consistently present and noticeable.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Overall a really nice sleeve in the consistent texture category. Generally on the tighter side with higher stimulation and a unique diamond texture that hits the frenulum and underside of the shaft, adding an extra focal point of pleasure and a sensational touch of variety to the stimulating grid that surrounds the rest of your member.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"May 21st, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mccal100",reviewer:"Mccal100",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_57a3ea25-6b92-493a-8196-7ba87942d5d0_grande.jpg?v=1679509759","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_727f1e2b-b791-425c-ae97-5baf7df2f3a9_grande.jpg?v=1679509759","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_ff1cef54-9bbc-4628-8862-fa39254b5132_grande.jpg?v=1679509759","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_14033e1f-2158-4ae7-a4bd-0eaa18371a2a_grande.jpg?v=1679509759","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_435da69d-13dd-4944-a3bd-c691ca5e90ce_grande.jpg?v=1679509759","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_dbf26dea-69ab-4800-99f3-ab2cf8817e45_grande.jpg?v=1679509759"]},{name:"Bumzumi",girl:"Kazumi",url:"/en/texture/bumzumi",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/bumzumi.jpg",scores:[4.11,3.81,4.05,4.16,3.93,3.03,3.64,3.13,4.05,3.44,3.47,3.23,3.18,3.92],description:"Prepare yourself for the ultimate backdoor sensation with the Bumzumi Fleshlight!

The mid section has a couple ribs and areas that create a pushing through feeling but all in all it is more of a subdued feeling. This sleeve is nice for longer sessions, but it is also pretty loud.

Those with sensitive members may also find this info helpful, as the effect is similar even if not 100% comparable. Whether due to girth or sensitivity, you don’t want textures that scrape badly. <br/>\n<br/>\nInfo for reference: just under 6” length, 7” shaft girth with a 5.5” head that’s fairly sensitive; all sessions done with sleeve flaps cut off (for looseness) + Fleshlight warmed &amp; locked down horizontally to thrust into (for better feeling sensations). If you’re girthy, but not 7” girthy, awesome – way more sleeves will work for you! Average these reviews with others, according to where on the girth spectrum you fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: if a sleeve works poorly for your girth due to the case allowing no more room to stretch, cutting a layer off the sleeve’s ring (that sits behind the case’s ring) can work wonders to reduce pressure and let you feel everything better. Just be careful of the sleeve falling out if used vertically, and always test out small adjustments before modding a sleeve any amount. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeeds girth mod: Maybe. With only 50% ring reduction it worked acceptably, but after the full modification I found it extra pleasurable and soft. Probably depends on how defined you want the bumps. <br/>\n<br/>\nSmoothness: 9/10. Don’t let the textures fool you – this is a super smooth sleeve, and is ideal if you want to avoid scraping on your skin. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: 5/10. It intensifies closer to orgasm as you swell up, but it truly is way more mellow than it looks. Though it feels completely gentle at first, don’t underestimate it, because the little bumps work over your head quite a bit... you might get more stimulated than you realize while thrusting hard and find yourself close to finishing early. <br/>\n<br/>\nSensation: 10/10. It’s fairly understated, and isn’t aggressive or super busy, but it feels great. Unexpectedly realistic, with no drastic changes in sensation, but softly stimulates and get the little tighter in the middle. Best of all, I found it could be thrusted into hard and fast without getting loud, immediately losing lubrication, or making you a little numb/overstimulated from textures rubbing on your head too hard. That’s a rarity, compared to a lot of “interesting” textures. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity During Orgasm: 4/10. It offers some strong sensations while finishing, but isn’t terrible at all. Though somewhat difficult to stroke through, I found it quite enjoyable, and it didn’t leave me raw like some sleeves. Be wary if you get sensitive during orgasm, but still, give it a shot.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Overall Experience: 10/10. A realistic, pleasant experience ideal for hard use and longer sessions, with a texture that’s just the right intensity to build up to “can’t hold back” levels of pleasure. Edging is also great in this sleeve, extremely pleasurable but without making you lose control. </p>\n</div>',review_time:"December 29th, 2017",reviewer_url:"/en/u/girthreviews",reviewer:"girthreviews",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/DillionHarper-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1594930901","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/DillionHarper-Gallery2_grande.jpg?v=1594930901","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/DillionHarper-Gallery4_grande.jpg?v=1594930901","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/DillionHarper-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1594930901","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/DillionHarper-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1594930901","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/DillionHarper-Gallery6_54e104f5-4100-468e-a514-458bf5cc0cb2_grande.jpg?v=1594930901","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/DillionHarper-Gallery_0000_IMG_0411_1_grande.jpg?v=1594930901","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/DillionHarper-Gallery_0001_IMG_0156_grande.jpg?v=1594930901","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/DillionHarper-Gallery_0002_IMG_0224_grande.jpg?v=1594930901","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/DillionHarper-Gallery_0003_DillionHarper-2880_x1420_grande.jpg?v=1594930901","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/DillionHarper-Gallery_0004_Group_2_copy_grande.jpg?v=1594930901"]},{name:"Alien Queen",girl:"",url:"/en/texture/alien-queen",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/alien-queen.jpg",scores:[3.26,3.55,3.73,2.85,3.03,2.77,2.29,3.02,4.01,3.94,3.75,4.08,3.77,3.93],description:"If you’ve ever fantasized about interstellar intercourse, you need more than just a run-of-the-mill alien girl to satisfy your needs – you need a queen!

Most of my reviews reference how that review FLight was accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to the review for the: Alien Queen Fleshlight<br/>\n<br/>\nHow I got it: I bought this in October 2021 during the Freaks Halloween Sale. The Alien Queen debuted in 2020 during the Freaks sale that had some issues. But in 2021, they did bring it back, and this time with a pearlescent darkish green color all across the sleeve. Now, this product is not normally for sale, but I will still put in a review in the case it makes an appearance in 2022 or future years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAesthetics: Like the Alien, you can tell this vulva is definitely a bit different. But unlike the Alien, the Alien Queen's vulva is oddly enough more similar to a human's vulva, but a little narrower and the entrance a bit lower too. The dark green pearlescent color is definitely a change. All in all, it seems rather inviting and not repelling to bring onself to enter.<br/>\n<br/>\nLube: As mentioned in the intro, I use Gun Oil H2O, which is a water-based lubricant. DO NOT USE the original silicone variant of lube or any silicone or oil lube. I did need a fair amount of lube to get started, but once the channel of pointy \"pyramid\" bumps/cones was lubed up, the lube amount held up for the duration of the flight. Not bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoise: I did loosen the cap just slightly to facilitate better thrusting, but this did not impact sound in any way. It's not super loud, but unless you are going to town and someone is either in the room or the door is open, highly unlikely one's going to hear what you're up to.<br/>\n<br/>\nPenetration: The penetration of the Alien Queen is pretty nice. I could feel the entry texture as my cock entered the Alien Queen's green vulva, which was a bunch of mini discs that feel like bumps but with a little bit more focus. Then my penis pushed into the longer \"pyramid bumps/cones\" which were not sharp, but I could definitely feel them. As I pulled back, the sensations repeated, but in reverse. In all, not a super intense penetration, but it felt nice and was satisfying enough to slowly pump into again, then build speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: Like the Alien, this sleeve looks intense but initially it is not. However, the various bumps of contact have a similar STU effect and over time you'll feel that intensity build. As I was FLying, I could tell that the \"pyramid bumps/cones\" was getting a bit more pronounced a few minutes into the FLight, and not too long after that, I had to decide if I wanted to go longer or donate my genetic material to the Queen (pun is intentional). I decided this time to not keep her waiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm: With a FL, there are three orgasms that tend to come about (pun intended). One is a gentle buildup that leads to a nice orgasm. Another is one that causes you to cum without warning. The last is a \"when you blow, you know.\" The Alien Queen is something of a third type of orgasm with something of the second type. I can tell that there are ways to draw out the FLight and really have a nice finish. But if you don't hold out, it will bring you to orgasm, and fairly quickly. As a result, I didn't have a real earth-shattering orgasm, but it was still nice and I felt the effort to FLy was worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleanup: Because of all the bumps, the Alien Queen does require a good rinsing. However, setting up a good warm (not super hot) stream of water from a sink and blasting water in both ends of the sleeve should remove all of the various deposits.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, I did acquire the Fleshlight AIR, and it is a game changer. If you have the AIR, take the lids off, rinse out the sleeve and case, and dry the case in full plus the exterior of the sleeve. Put the sleeve back into the case but do not put the lids back on. Screw the FL into the AIR and turn the AIR on for 40 minutes (two pushes of the button). Unscrew the FL, recap the FL and it's ready to go again. If you don't have an AIR, the best way to help the drying process is with good quality paper towels. Use care running the towel through the canal. After it is mostly dry to dry (paper towels won't get it all dry), leave FL uncapped to allow air drying. If you need to conceal the sleeve, stick the sleeve and case in a old (but clean) t-shirt loosely to allow air to vent.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Admittedly, the Alien Queen is not a top tier sleeve, but it's got a nice visual look plus a enjoyable texture for those who would like to play out their extraterrestrial fantasies a bit. The Alien Queen is also not for sale most of the time, so if the opportunity happens, it's worth a look as it's a pretty solid experience. If not, plenty of other great sleeves to enjoy.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 16th, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/revtwentyseven",reviewer:"revtwentyseven",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Cosmic",girl:"Gina Valentina",url:"/en/texture/cosmic",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/cosmic.jpg",scores:[3.38,3.5,3.7,4.23,4.06,2.72,2.46,3.65,3.92,3.76,3.75,3.76,3.39,3.92],description:"A true cosmic shift in Fleshlight design, this sexual sensation is unlike any to come before it.

Get ready for an other-worldly anal adventure!",review:"<div class=\"text\">\n<p>\nWelcome to another review by yours truly, revtwentyseven!<br/>\n<br/>\nA few points of info when reading my reviews:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am circumcised, use Gun Oil H20 lube, and generally FLy several times with each sleeve, including once prior to the review. Most of my reviews reference how that review FLight was accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to the review for the Cosmic (butt) sleeve of Gina Valentina!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow I got it: I bought this during the BF/CM 2023 sales, in pursuit of expanding my collection.<br/>\n<br/>\nAesthetics: I have to admit, butt sleeves are growing on me, and Gina Valentina's rear entry looks realistic and inviting. Also, the mold does show a small part of her vulva, which adds a little more realism.<br/>\n<br/>\nLube: As mentioned in the intro, I use Gun Oil H2O, which is a water-based lubricant. DO NOT USE the original silicone variant of lube or any silicone or oil lube. This is a sleeve that needs a little bit more lube than normal because the points of each \"wave\" can sometimes trap lube as it's pushed in. <br/>\n<br/>\nNoise: The Cosmic sleeve does not generate too much noise from the norm for Fleshlight sleeves, and it was not overly noticeable. If you are alone in your room when you use it, it's doubtful others will hear it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPenetration: Penetrating into Cosmic was quite pleasurable. It is a butt sleeve, so expect it to be just a tad tighter as you enter. I encountered some gaggles of small bumps along the way in the sleeve, which feel nicer as the FLight continues, but what really got me started was the points of each wave as I pushed into the sleeve, and then as I pulled back. It's just enough stimulation to want to push in again. As I did, I felt the other elements of the texture start to assert itself upon me, which leads to...<br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: The longer I've flown with FLs, the more convinced I've become that the sleeves are seemingly reflective of the character of the FLG its made after. In the case of Cosmic, it's Gina Valentina. I feel that Cosmic is a sleeve that is not afraid to go after you with intensity, but wants to ease you into it before showing its full power. As the FLight continued, and I got more and more into the session, I became more aware of the various bumps and elements besides the waves. I imagine someone with more girth than myself probably would feel that sooner. However, all of those sensations eventually signal the inevitable release. With some management, you can go a little while with this sleeve, but the fun doesn't last forever, and I had to release.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm: With a FL, there are three orgasms that tend to come about (pun intended). One is a gentle buildup that leads to a nice orgasm. Another is one that causes you to cum without warning. The last is a \"when you blow, you know.\" Cosmic was somewhere in the middle of 1 and 3. I could build up if I really, really wanted to, but if you want to go, you'll know you blew. The orgasm was nice and enjoyable (not earth shattering, but not lacking either), but based on the position of the waves, trying to thrust and stroke a few more times was a little too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleanup: A good steady stream of warm/hot water will easily remove all of the lube and aftermath, but do take some time, and make sure you clear that snug area of bumps of any byproduct. Consider running the stream of water through both ends. And with the wave points, be prepared for a ample stream of water. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you have the Fleshlight AIR, drying is a breeze. Dry the outer sleeve and the case, put the sleeve back in the case, with neither lid on and screw in the FL to the AIR and turn the AIR on. I have stored my AIR away for the time being and did not use it to dry Cosmic, but I imagine two or three presses of the on button for the AIR (40-60 minutes) should suffice to get your sleeve totally dry. Unscrew from AIR, recap the FL and it's ready to go again. If you don't have a AIR, Paper Towels (and quality paper towels, not store brand economy towels) are your next best friend. Run them through the canal a few times (be careful not to tear them). Then leave out in open air to dry (if you need to conceal the sleeve, stick in a old (but clean) t-shirt loosely to allow air to vent.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Cosmic is a solid sleeve. For those who want a more tighter experience and perhaps exercise some anal fantasies, this is a pretty solid sleeve for that. It's also worthwhile for someone who wants quite a few sleeves. </p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 15th, 2023",reviewer_url:"/en/u/revtwentyseven",reviewer:"revtwentyseven",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_4651636f-383d-4243-99fc-73e90846e93f_grande.jpg?v=1628178349","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_ec9f5cfc-c713-4793-a617-ffeb8b8da58f_grande.jpg?v=1628178349","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_4bbf922d-055e-4a0d-bd08-643afa81e84c_grande.jpg?v=1628178349","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_546a84be-1bd7-4626-875a-026025163279_grande.jpg?v=1628178368","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_357326fb-df65-45ca-a418-cc1f78a6cbca_grande.jpg?v=1628178349","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_766fdfd6-dffa-4149-b177-b9069cf85782_grande.jpg?v=1628178349"]},{name:"Ignition",girl:"",url:"/en/texture/ignition",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/ignition.jpg",scores:[3.58,3.82,3.64,3.05,4.03,3.18,3.76,3.19,3.99,2.72,3.3,3.13,3.22,3.91],description:"The Fleshlight Turbo™ offers you the most realistic and satisfying alternative to oral sex.

I hardly ever pull out. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nAngela White's Indulge was yet another sleeve I couldn't resist simply due to the model attached to it. Angela White's labia is one of the most appealing in the biz and Fleshlight captured its enticing nature, one of my favorites. Once you insert, you're immediately met with the main feature of the massaging beads. This is like a less intense version of Obsession. There's very little variation other than the undulating tightness of the canal. Despite lack of physical variation, this makes for a more equal sleeve, where you don't feel like you're missing out if you cant hit the last couple inches. It may look like it gets tight towards the end but it remains a fairly loose sleeve at all sections. In order to feel the effect of all the little nubs on your penis, it feels better to use this with full strokes instead of short small ones. It's also better to hit the vaginal walls at an angle in order to make sure your tip rubs up against all those little nodules. Because of the loose smoothness, the suction on this isnt too tight or restricting, yet still has an effect. The suction does make a loud sound when pulling out but usually the sleeve is pretty quite with the cap on. This sleeve is ideal for slow edging sessions. It requires not a lot of lube, too much lube tends to dull the texture.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Not a must own by any means, but it replicates the silky smoothness one would imagine Angela White's vagina feels like.

Every thrust deep inside her orifice makes for maximum pleasure, ensuring you the ultimate orgasm.",review:'<div class="text">\n<p>\n*NOTE: This review is for the first iteration of Utopia, as there has supposedly been a minor update to the inner texture. The nubs throughout the sleeve texture appear a lot more pronounced than they are in the actual sleeve I own. Not sure if the updated version features a more prominent texture, so maybe other reviews can attest to this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Fleshlight purchases are not normally based around the signature-girl, but - as a big Riley Reid fan - and the fact the texture seemed like a good medium-intensity sleeve, this was on my list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sleeve has a nice tight, ribbed opening to slide into before opening into the first main section, which is a chamber with small nubs around the inside. This then passes through a "choke point" of 4 large triangular nubs in the first 3-4 inches or so before passing into another canal with a spiral of tiny nubs running around the inside of a canal of similar diameter.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall the sleeve feels moderately tight and offers a great hugging sensation throughout. Whilst they may be small, the nubs inside both sections of the canal offer decent stimulation; certainly more than their size might suggest (the new cross-section image of Utopia appears to be a lot more pronounced in texture, but mine appears to be more subdued). The choke point also feels fantastic as it strikes the penis head moving back and forth through it. The combo of a subtle but consistently stimulating texture and some degree of tightness mean this sleeve strikes a great balance of stimulation with the capacity for edging. But note the word *capacity*, as this one feels so good from the start that it may be hard to resist Utopia bringing you to an early orgasm.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome sleeves require some "tuning in to" to get the best out of them, but I took to this one right from first penetration. It\'s an easy one to enjoy. Whilst it doesn\'t look intense, it competes well with some of my more intense sleeves because of it\'s capacity to deliver both long and short sessions dependng on how I use it.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>One for the fans of tighter "college chick" sleeves, Utopia is an enjoyable sleeve that offers enough medium-stimulation for a fun ride, but not so much it\'s over in a flash.

Also the end cap is always open and I use 3 Fleshlight Girls at a time mostly.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nOrifice:<br/>\nI used to own the Kayden Kross Bookworm sleeve, so I will just paste in here what I wrote about the orifice as they are both the same:<br/>\nKayden\'s orifice is quite detailed. Her lips are sticking out a lot. That makes it not too easy to hit the target. But once you are inside, her lips are wrapping around your dick comfortably. It actually feels really nice to penetrate Kayden Kross\' vagina, especially when watching a scene of her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSleeve:<br/>\nAs you enter you are greeted by nubs, that are arranged in a spiral. Those nubs can be felt noticeably, but they are very soft. More noticable is the next section, which is very intense. This section feels like what you would expect by lookin at the cross section of Destroya. The nubs in this section almost develop a scratching sensation, but it is not too much to be unpleasant. I was suprised by the amount of intensity in that section, but you will feel some kind of relief in the follwing section. The ribs still feel intense on your dick, but in different more organic way. As this is the last part that I can reach I would rate this as a good conclusion to an intense sleeve.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>This texture deserves more attention. Many people are looking for "the most intense" Fleshlight and I think this is one of the best sleeves to recommend in that case. Furthermore the orifice really stands out compared to other Fleshlight Girls. Initially I got Kayden Kross Ultimate, because my Bookworm sleeve developed a really bad tear. Being a big fan of Kayden I knew I had to try out her new texture and I am truly happy with my purchase. I wouldn\'t recommend this as first sleeve, though.

I've got a small Asian cock lol. <br/>\n<br/>\nReview:<br/>\nThis is my first FL ever and the things that mattered most to me in making a purchase was clean-up, dry time, lube efficiency and realism. The Dragon is a very simple and consistent texture that makes it easy to clean and quick to dry, which can help make the FL last longer. As a result of the consistent texture, the Dragon may not feel as intense as other FLs, which some may dismiss as boring, but I like to consider it to be more 'realistic' due to the lesser intensity. Furthermore, the consistent texture makes me feel like I'm not missing out on anything, which adds more value to this FL considering my short size. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany people have said that the Dragon is intended for larger penises, but as a guy with a less than average penis, I would not skip out on the Dragon, or any other FL that's more suited for larger penises. The Dragon is plenty tight, and the suction/milking action of it as you slide in and out of it is out of this world. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe suction in combination with the consistent texture really grips onto my penis, allowing me to feel the texture every step of the way. This combination actually makes up for my small girth by consistently squeezing the length of my penis, making it feel tighter the more you close the end cap. This fleshlights is not as intense as a result of its consistent texture, but this puts you more in control over your orgasm. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can slide as fast as you want, or as slow as you want to build up your nut. I really enjoy taking it slow without pushing my whole penis in and then gradually getting more intense with slow while pushing further in, before adding more lube to pound away and finish. It feels like I'm really earning my orgasm with the Dragon and the low intensity gives me more control over when I want to nut.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Overall, this is a really smooth FL that's completely fine for any size. Don't be discouraged by other reviewers saying it's for bigger penises. The suction and milking feeling it provides makes up for your size. The Dragon is a low intensity FL that grants you control over when you want to nut and lets you build up to your limit in a very smooth, gradual pace. I highly recommend this FL for anyone who doesn't want the FL to force you to nut too quickly, and prefers a nice, smooth, controlled and paced FL. </p>\n</div>",review_time:"August 1st, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/ifaponthetoilet",reviewer:"ifaponthetoilet",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/AsaAkira-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1506625404","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0000_FL_01605_H4A4392_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0001_FL_00570_H4A3478_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0002_FL_01340_H4A4127_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0003_FL_01866_H4A4523_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0004_FL_01679_DSC2177_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0005_FL_01117_H4A3977_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0006_FL_01230_DSC2096_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0007_FL_00375_H4A3264_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Asa-Gallery_0008_FL_01962_H4A4619_Asa_Akira_Texas_grande.jpg?v=1617906010"]},{name:"Toy Meets World",girl:"Maitland Ward",url:"/en/texture/toy-meets-world",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/toy-meets-world.jpg",scores:[3.25,3.65,3.26,2.85,3.14,3.31,3.35,3.46,3.91,3.35,3.42,3.72,3.47,3.87],description:"Maitland Ward’s Toy Meets World texture will have you ready to plow ahead more than even one of Mr. Feeny’s pep talks.

Now onto the review!</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nToy Meets World is on the looser side of sleeves and generally lower-mid intensity, while still providing solid stimulation through out. What makes this a great sleeve is how well everything transitions in a natural manner without any jarring or sudden changes in texture. The initial horizontal ridges can be felt the whole way through, providing nice stimulation for a mellow ride into the coin ridges to follow. These coins continue the trend of an easy flight and are actually less intense than the previous section. The triangular ridges that follow allow for the extra kick needed to push to the finish line and are the most intense and stimulating of the three areas I can reach. Overall it’s a nice level of stimulation when looking for a more relaxed session to slowly ramp up to an excellent finish.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>A nice sleeve if you’re looking for something that’s not too intense or want something on the looser side while still being stimulated enough to keep things interesting. An excellent choice if you prefer edging but still possible to keep your sessions relatively quicker if needed.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"March 1st, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mccal100",reviewer:"Mccal100",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_f0cd8531-74fc-416d-929b-f9a647f2ec50_grande.jpg?v=1621274577","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_9cf78962-1ff5-442f-84b5-378a4d3877cb_grande.jpg?v=1621274577","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_c0983244-4680-4a04-84a8-472b4db543b7_grande.jpg?v=1621274577","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_182c3b92-a84a-44ab-b617-255d1aceff6c_grande.jpg?v=1621274577","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_b4f3cc44-7492-45d0-8ad0-9be67743d211_grande.jpg?v=1621274577","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_8061d242-9eec-4690-9e9f-00b1c0331638_grande.jpg?v=1621274577"]},{name:"Honey",girl:"Lena The Plug",url:"/en/texture/honey",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/honey.jpg",scores:[3.16,3.75,3.48,3.14,3.63,3.57,3.29,3.71,3.9,3.55,3.43,3.85,3.53,3.87],description:"",review:"<div class=\"text\">\n<p>\nHoney is as the name implies a sweet and soft sleeve, that is in my opinion made for edging and it's pretty easy to do in this one. It's a sleeve that isn't intense but still stimulating, resulting in a very dreamy sleeve like someone giving you a back massage but on your gentleman. that's why I would say it's almost more of a massager than a masturbaitor and I tend to use it more with soft-core or erotic-asmr to get the most out of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen taking a first look at the sleeve the first thing you will notice is these beautiful inviting lips that are highly detailed, they are pretty wide allowing for easy access and some fun foreplay like grinding or other tease play . They also give the lips that grip look which is very pleasant to look at, but sadly not the feeling maybe they are a bit to w or to shallow the lips are pretty tucked in the sleeve itself. Still the best set of lips of all the sleeves I own.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst section of the sleeve, this is it's strength and if the sleeve was 100% this texture I would have enjoyed it just as much.<br/>\nWhen you enter you immediately get engulfed by a wide meaty feeling, the ribs massage your shaft with a sort of wavy feeling and if you wait a second after a thrust you can feel them fight back to get in original position, twist and turns improve this effect, but be careful if you are a person who likes to go fast this feeling will be gone and it will be like a bland wide sleeve. <br/>\nOn the other hand if you overapply lube you cut out the wavy feeling and you are left with a pretty realistic meaty feeling in the first section of the sleeve, reminds me of a wider vagina, however this is countered by the 2nd section.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2nd section of the sleeve. these fins are a teaser for the head they are quite sturdy and you will definitely notice them, especially when pulling back out you will notice them stimulating your frenulum.<br/>\nLike with the first section twist and turns makes it feel better, as for the balls in between the fins I honestly don't feel them. Think they are to close to the fins for me to pick up such a small detail.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther bits and bobs:<br/>\n<br/>\nLube use: I use h2o, works great with this sleeve even with long edging sessions, I do however like to use some on the head of the sleeve so it doesn't cause friction when turning.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoise: it's on the quieter side, not completely stealthy but getting close.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleaning and Drying: No problems here just like most sleeves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading my review, hopes this helps you, but do note that I don't own many of the popular sleeves.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a fun thing at the end, don't know anything about Lena, but at a first glance, this sleeve just doesn't suit her at all there is no fierceness no bite, it's more of your hippie relaxed kumbaya kind of sleeve.<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Honey is wider sleeve that doesn't feel wide it has a very meaty feeling to it. It's perfect for edging even for beginners.<br/>\nIt's not intense but not bland and boring either, it's very stimulating. If you are interested in fast paced intense action stay clear of this sleeve, but if you like a slow session with a nice relaxing dreamy experience this might be the sleeve for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really enjoy this sleeve it has an unique role in my collection.<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n</div>",review_time:"May 8th, 2019",reviewer_url:"/en/u/darkpizzacutter",reviewer:"DarkPizzacutter",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_bf779c20-9910-4b98-aba2-95d4fdad9825_grande.jpg?v=1620229727","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_f14d5383-586c-423d-9458-8bac0539e04d_grande.jpg?v=1620229727","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_8edac438-fa4b-4472-b0a9-d922b6818a1d_grande.jpg?v=1620229727","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_57a905bf-6f8d-4745-9f46-1a63410c719a_grande.jpg?v=1620229727","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_5c815224-b70d-4e02-8661-bb6d389e9b5a_grande.jpg?v=1620229727","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_803d3075-a3ff-4dbe-9521-16dfc28ee6d7_grande.jpg?v=1620229727"]},{name:"Royal",girl:"Tanya Tate",url:"/en/texture/royal",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/royal.jpg",scores:[2.98,3.42,3.9,3.28,3.41,3.45,3.28,3.77,3.83,3.84,3.91,3.83,3.62,3.86],description:"British sensation Tanya Tate's Royal texture is nothing short of a luxurious pleasure experience for your penis.

My only complaint for her mold is the her lips/labia are uneven, the left side is more noticeable when going in straight and it creates a sort of pushing sensation on the left side. That being said when turning it sideways it makes up for the complaint, the uneven nature of puts more pressure on the top/bottom of your head during entry. Since there are currently no mouth sleeves being offered, I like to turn the labia sideways and imagine it's a mouth, not perfect but it works well enough. And, with one labia being more noticeable you could imagine a woman with a bigger bottom/upper lip is working you with her mouth. In this way this sleeve is probably on of the better ones for that. A negative turned into a positive, a rarity for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe texture is one of my all time favorites, not so intense that I cum quick, unless I want to, but still very stimulating. The rings at the opening are more noticeable at first but once you start to build up sensation it's amazing changing it up between longer and shallow strokes. I can reach about an inch and half into the wavy section taken from the forbidden sleeve. Going back and forth between the smooth wavy texture and rings at the beginning is incredible. The last ring before going into the wavy pattern is really noticeable on the back on my head when pulling backwards, sort of like a lotus node. I often spend a lot of time at that area, pulling back just enough so that ring goes most of the way down my head then pushing back in, it's like smooth in front on the tip of the head and a griping sensation on the back of the head, one of the better sensations I have found with Fleshlights. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe orgasms with this sleeve are some of the better ones I've have, I can normally stroke through them, they are not usually the killer oh no I'm gonna faint kind, but they are really good.<br/>\n<br/>\nClean up and dry time are about the same as any average sleeve. I alternate water though both sides repeatedly so it changes the pressure to get all the wholesome goodness, so to speak, out of the sleeve. I always have a fan on near my bed when sleeping, so to dry I just pat down the outside with paper towel and set it in front of the fan, typically it dries overnight.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>If I could only pick one sleeve to have this one would be a front runner and most likely would be the one sleeve to rule them all lol.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 10th, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/xout16",reviewer:"xout16",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Booty Lust",girl:"Kendra Lust",url:"/en/texture/booty-lust",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/booty-lust.jpg",scores:[3.49,3.53,4.08,4.03,3.8,3.63,3.26,3.51,3.8,3.82,3.44,3.82,3.53,3.9],description:"If there’s one thing Kendra Lust is known for it is her natural and voluptuous derrière.

This area, along with the middle ribs, are pretty reminiscent of the thicker ribs at the start of Kendra Sunderland’s Angel but slightly softer making for a little less intensity than Angel’s version. The chamber between these two is pretty smooth but the round bumps can be felt and offer some resistance and stimulation, apart from feeling really nice on the glans and frenulum when stroking, this area mainly serves as a bit more relaxed space to transition between the 1st heavy wave of ridges and the second smaller more sharp but still softer and thicker than the usual rib area in the center of the sleeve. The width of these ribs makes each one stand out much stronger individually as you can clearly notice when you pass one rib to the next. The back stroke is especially nice due to the added sensation on the glans that is created do the prominence of each rib as both a stand alone sensation along with the pleasure created through feeling yourself stroke by all of them together like a wave of speed bumps. These are the only 3 sections I reach but are enough to make for a very enjoyable sleeve.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>A solid sleeve that I imagine anyone who is a fan of Angel or ribbed sleeves, particularly thick ribs, would really appreciate.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"March 10th, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mccal100",reviewer:"Mccal100",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_1_b53874bc-2d54-4253-9478-2c526d79f23e_grande.jpg?v=1625767205","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_2_12290112-ad2b-4718-a66b-bfa7bda0b63f_grande.jpg?v=1625767205","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_3_66d99e51-c6af-4a36-a84a-a57f54857d66_grande.jpg?v=1625767205","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_4_6034f906-18c1-4d9c-90a2-75a09b14a6ad_grande.jpg?v=1625767205","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_5_26b6f839-9b86-4058-ba2e-33d9fee04f1b_grande.jpg?v=1625767205","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery_6_b520b307-3420-4c14-801b-5f58da584b2f_grande.jpg?v=1625767205"]},{name:"Alien",girl:"",url:"/en/texture/alien",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/alien.jpg",scores:[3.31,3.64,3.36,2.8,3.28,2.48,3.14,3.53,3.84,3.29,3.44,3.66,3.45,3.83],description:"The new Fleshlight Alien has landed, bringing along worlds of pleasure.

Hey, haven't you seen an Alien pussy before? No? Well it's exactly like this! Just kidding...or am I?? Hey, the Freaks line has a big fantasy element in it so why not go along with it?

There's really no downside for me. The gorgeous shiny blue color, the ribbed vagina...not to mention the 2 gigantic clits! WOW! Time to turn the tables and probe this Alien!<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE ENTRY: Somewhat loose. The inverted triangular shape of the vagina really sucks your penis in! It feels great rubbing your head on it.

That feels intense and amazing and makes me want to come immediately, so I have to pull it off of me. While it's still out of the case, I dangle it over me and lower the narrow end onto my penis, covering it with the sleeve (the STU bumps feel great sliding over my head!) I gotta tell you, it kind of looks like tentacle sex, so if you're into that, then, \"bonus!\" I highly recommend this sleeve, even for smaller guys. Even though I can only reach the vortex part, I think of it as a Mini-Vortex, and it feels pretty good. So what if you can't reach the other parts? This sleeve has so much else going for it, so I highly recommend it. Even if it's purely for the fantasy element.<br/>\n<br/>\nBONUS: Go down on it. Ya gotta try it! Also it comes with the dark blue case, but I've never used it. Get a clear case instead! It looks like having sex with some sort of science project!

I'm just a normal dude, who was wise enough to know that isolation meant less access to social situations, and most importantly - women. So SPECS: average male just under 6 inches, girth (?) <br/>\n<br/>\nI own 3 fleshlights and I purchased these out of efficiency and online reviews: LVL UP, DESTROYA, TEXAS TORNADO. I'm the product of mainstream reviews where rightly so, the average horny dude should start their journey. The community is wise. BUT.<br/>\n<br/>\nListen. We've been told about the 7 modern wonders of the world. The Texas Tornado is the 8th. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've tried the Destroya and the LVLUP which are good, but if you want realism /smoothness/ pleasures of 56 realities combined the TORNADO has your name on it. I don't care if you're into anal (that's the outer orifice visual) the texture is true to life or better. As a dude new to this who wanted to throw money at hedonistic desires, this was the cream of the crop. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's smooth, it's varied in a very subtle way, it's just loose enough to mimic the real deal.

This is one of the looser fleshjack boys, but I say that in a relative sense because it is still a moderately tight sleeve. The oriface has a decent amount of detail and the opening is one of the larger ones for the product line, which is a positive because it's easy to enter and has a broken in feel to it. The cheeks are quite deep and the oriface is more recessed than other fleshjacks I own, which gives it a great cushioned feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's difficult to describe this sleeve because there's a lot going on, but I can say the asymmetrical texture is awesome because as you pass through the sleeve, you will encounter bumps which feel like a real butt. This sleeve is unique because it is so stimulating without being an extremely tight texture. Something about it just feels like good anal sex. Turning the sleeve and approaching from different angles also provides different sensations due to the texture layout. This sleeve would be ideal for someone who is above average size due to its relaxed features. Those well below average may find this sleeve to be too loose and may better enjoy one of the tighter sleeves. Lube use and cleanup/drying are all about average as expected.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>This is one of my all time favorite sleeves and I would definitely consider adding this to a collection if you want a stimulating, moderately intense sleeve with a looser opening and feel.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"June 7th, 2022",reviewer_url:"/en/u/shred0502",reviewer:"shred0502",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Flex",girl:"Nicole Aniston",url:"/en/texture/flex",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/flex.jpg",scores:[3.6,3.34,3.61,3.46,3.53,3.01,3.22,2.83,3.66,3.38,3.6,3.37,3.26,3.83],description:"Nicole Aniston is known for her hardbody and amazing physique.

I'm an 7.25 in. long and 5.75 inch girth. I inspect each sleeve for texture, uniformity and I use the sleeve 3 times before committing to a review. That way I'm thorough and as detailed as possible. Your ticket to find out exactly what you want before you buy. It's time to review our next Fleshlight! <br/>\n<br/>\nWide open pussy lips invite you into a surprisingly tight entrance, before widening out into the first small chamber. Two rings of bumps encircle this space before it tightens again with a 0.4” (10mm) constriction which acts as an entrance to the next section.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext comes the main chamber, starting at 2.5” (60mm) from the entrance. This section has a texture made from different shaped bumps - a double row of small bumps, a single row of larger pointed bumps, and a couple of rows of longer ridges – all running in a spiral pattern around its walls.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final section of the Attack begins at around 6.25” (155mm) from the entrance of the sleeve and starts with another tight constriction which looks a little like a Lotus node. Here, there are three chambers, separated by tight constrictions and narrowing towards the end of the sleeve.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tight entrance and first chamber creates immediate sensation around the tip of the penis; you begin to feel the ‘rewards’ of this sleeve as soon as you enter in the form of two tight constrictions and pinpricks of sensation from the first two sets of bumps.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main chamber provides a contrast as you push through the second narrowing into the wide open space. I enjoyed penetrating this section several times before moving further into the sleeve.<br/>\nThe bumps in the main chamber are subtle and not really perceptible individually, but there is still definitely some sensation as they ‘swirl’ around the penis in their spiraling patterns. It’s a gentle and quite realistic feeling: a bit like pushing deep into a real pussy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tightness of the final constrictions towards the end is another pleasing contrast and a great way to end this sleeve. Unfortunately, I could not enter the final section fully - only guys with longer than average penises will be able to get right to the end. But even bumping up against the tight end to the main chamber was enjoyable and added to the realism of the whole experience. <br/>\n<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Overall, this was a really nice sleeve. The texture was subtle but combined well with the tightening and widening, especially near the entrance, to create a really nice and very realistic feeling. If you need intense textures then this one is not for you but if you are looking for realism in your sex toys then the Christy Mack Attack Fleshlight is a good option.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"October 3rd, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/stiffpoles",reviewer:"stiffpoles",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Primal",girl:"FLG EU",url:"/en/texture/primal",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/primal.jpg",scores:[4.2,4.07,3.82,3.71,3.48,2.63,3.97,2.54,3.78,3.24,2.97,2.74,2.52,3.82],description:"Satisfy your most primal instincts with this ultra-intense texture.

Like any anal adventure, make sure you use plenty of lube to help you glide through LoveSack's gripping inner texture.",review:"<div class=\"text\">\n<p>\nThis is the first review I have written on here so please pardon any minor issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off let’s get one thing straight, I LOVE this sleeve and think that everyone should at least try it if they get the chance. Quick aside, the FleshAssist page and older reviews call it a LoveSack but, at time of writing it is listed as a FleshSack on both the Fleshlight and Fleshjack websites. I am assuming that the trademark fell through (or something along those lines) and they had to change it. Which is a shame because IMO LoveSack was a much better name. Regardless I just wanted to point that out to hopefully alleviate any confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterior<br/>\nTo be completely honest this is the only part I was really worried about in purchasing this sleeve. It looks underwhelming to say the least. I usually lean more towards the higher intensity end of the texture spectrum and it did not look like this would live up to that. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the texture. It is repetitive but manages to be enjoyable even without the elephant (balls) in the room. The texture is helped a decent bit by the offset entrance. This is the only Fleshlight I know of with an off center opening, this is probably to put the balls at just the right height for that glorious slapping action, but it has the added benefit of pushing you into the texture at a bit of an angle. Meaning that the interior alone (if the balls fell off or something) would make for a great edging sleeve, stimulating but sedate enough to last a good while. <br/>\n<br/>\nExterior<br/>\nUpon seeing those balls on the website, you felt something, didn’t you? Maybe you were repulsed, intrigued or maybe just a bit confused. Personally, I knew immediately that I HAD to try that. Well first off let me tell you that the balls are even larger in person. Seriously, I could not even hazard a guess what optical illusion they used in the marketing pictures to make them look that small. Imagine a three-inch diameter sphere of that superb FL material hanging off the base of the orifice. It is a (literal) hand full, and it adds a lot to the experience. I have heard other people complain of the sleeve popping out of the case during use, I have not run into this issue and the sleeve appears to have extra material around the collar on the inside of the casing to prevent it from jumping out (I purchased it over a month after it came out so it is possible this got fixed). What I am trying to say is if you are in this for the balls you will not be disappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting it all together<br/>\nGiven the interior being slightly milder I had expected this to be an awesome sleeve for edging. I was wrong, I tried going slow but just could not do it. The balls taping against mine lead me to speed up to full speed until it drained me faster and more completely than anything else. At first, I assumed that this was just a first-time thing, but I have been using it for a week now and it has yet to disappoint. I hope they roll out a whole damn line of these on Fleshjack or Fleshlight (Daisy Taylor anyone?) soon because until they do this will be the only sleeve I use.<br/>\n<br/>\nReddit<br/>\nA strange tangent to veer down, but please humor me here. Because this short passage drove me to write this. To quote a wise Redditor over on the r/fleshlight subreddit… <br/>\n<br/>\n“When I saw the picture of the product. I was hoping it was a tongue. Got all excited. But took a closer look and it was a set of balls. ???? That s#it turned me off. I don't want to use a Fleshlight. And imagine my balls slapping against some other dudes sack. Put that on the Fleahjack site. I'm sure those guys would be interested. Make a fleshlight vaginal orifice with a tongue on the bottom. It'll sell out in 24hrs. ???????????? would be interested.”<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me pose a question, what is the difference between a ball stimulating tongue and ball stimulating balls in this context? At the end of the day either is a chunk of inorganic material serving the exact same purpose. This redditor would clearly love this Fleshlight and is letting the aesthetic wall him off from a awesome product that does exactly what they are looking for. Those balls make the Fleshlight a lot more fun, please do not let some nagging scrap of homophobia keep you from trying something this enjoyable. Trust me, this product is awesome but it isn’t enough to make you gay (But if it does, feel free to hit me up ????)<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>TL;DR<br/>\nYou looked at this page, so clearly you are curious. Buy a FleshSack because (in my opinion) it is the best Fleshlight you can buy. <br/>\n<br/>\nPS. Buy some cornstarch to treat the balls from time to time. Otherwise they get sticky, and the last thing you want is sticky balls.

Now onto the review!</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nSupreme starts off with a cone of many horizontal ridges tapering into a nice choke point about 1.5” in, which makes for a nice penetration effect, welcoming you into the sleeves main textures. The follow ribs are nice on the head, especially against the glans on the out strokes and are a nice transition warming your head up for what’s to come when thrusting deeper into the center chamber but, when fully in the sleeve, they aren’t really as noticeable on the shaft, with all the stimulation and intensity of the staggered fins taking over and the initial choke point hugging your shaft closer to the base. The center chamber looks very misleading in the sleeve preview picture but it’s actually a series of staggered shark fin-esque bumps that, due to the shape and amount of them, are continuously making contact with different parts of the head and shaft with a concentrated stimulation from each individual fin providing a pleasurable resistance with how they hold on while you thrust as long as they can until each one individually gives in, only to be replaced by another fin to do the same. I don’t reach deep enough to feel the much, if any, of the chamber that follows, and with this main area being so pronounced, it quickly occupies all of my focus on the stimulation the fins provide.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Overall a really good sleeve with a unique middle chamber comprised of fin type protrusions coming at all angles to bring you to climax while keeping a firm hold on the shaft through the choke point close to the entrance</p>\n</div>',review_time:"March 13th, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mccal100",reviewer:"Mccal100",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/KaydenKross-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1547495263","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/KaydenKross-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1547495263","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/KaydenKross-Gallery2_grande.jpg?v=1547495263","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/KaydenKross-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1547495263","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/KaydenKross-Gallery6_grande.jpg?v=1547495263","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/KaydenKross-Gallery4_grande.jpg?v=1547495263","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/KaydenKross-Gallery3_0000_Exposure_1_grande.jpg?v=1547495263","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/KaydenKross-Gallery3_0001__H4A4379_FL_Austin_2016_Kayden_Kross_grande.jpg?v=1547495263","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/KaydenKross-Gallery3_0002__H4A2616_FL_Austin_2016_Kayden_Kross_grande.jpg?v=1547495263","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/KaydenKross-Gallery3_0003__H4A3924_FL_Austin_2016_Kayden_Kross_grande.jpg?v=1547495263","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/KaydenKross-Gallery3_0004__H4A5340_FL_Austin_2016_Kayden_Kross_grande.jpg?v=1547495263"]},{name:"Fanatic",girl:"Henessy",url:"/en/texture/fanatic",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/fanatic.jpg",scores:[2.87,3.43,3.51,2.76,3.25,3.14,3.48,3.42,4,3.66,3.65,3.63,3.71,3.8],description:"Upon penetrating Henessy’s Fanatic, you’re immediately met with a tight and narrow chamber that includes pleasure rings and a stimulating texture grid.

The ribs stand out a lot and keep a nice grip on your shaft. The effect created with its constant grabbing and letting go as each rib and ridge catch you is a really nice stimulation to go along with their thickness adding resistance and some extra intensity through their sturdy structure. The angled, triangular bumps are less prominent in comparison, but provide a nice added variety with their more forgiving edges allowing you to glide through them smoothly. The spiraled ribs transition very organically into the rings of squares after, keeping the same level of intensity and similar resistance with just enough give between the two. These squares provide a pleasurable destination for the head as the spirals work their way around and along your shaft and both chambers have a really nice rub along the glans when pulling back through them. <br/>\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Fanatic manages to find a perfect balance by having firm textures within a looser sleeve to provide strong identifiable sensations with enough give and space inside to keep them firmly in the pleasureable zone without becoming too rough.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"March 16th, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mccal100",reviewer:"Mccal100",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_232eeab0-e977-4542-b296-37110be98c73_grande.jpg?v=1600455513","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_78d95bef-5a9b-4f2a-ab41-38dbc22ac2a6_grande.jpg?v=1600455503","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_00fe2f56-147c-47f8-b286-2a256ba315e1_grande.jpg?v=1600455503","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_96d4632e-15a6-48c9-b361-1749579501d5_grande.jpg?v=1600455503","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_5cec20cc-25d8-492e-a21d-1502bbfa0bba_grande.jpg?v=1600455523","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_58f1b8fd-155e-4ca6-b5a3-b86f0499744a_grande.jpg?v=1600455503"]},{name:"Divinity",girl:"Jessica Drake",url:"/en/texture/divinity",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/divinity.jpg",scores:[3.27,3.44,3.39,3.29,3.46,3.12,3.19,3.08,3.7,3.79,3.79,3.76,3.62,3.78],description:"Nothing is more divine than penetrating Wicked Pictures' contract star Jessica Drake from the backside.

This is the most unique and intense feeling texture we offer; it feels like nothing else you've ever tried.",review:'<div class="text">\n<p>\n1. General and Visuals<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "Lotus Garden" texture comes only in one flavor: A flesh-tone vulva. That is perfectly fine with me as I generally prefer both the "flesh-tone" color and vaginal orifices on my Fleshlights. Like every vulva, it is a beautiful sight. Unlike some of the other molds, however, it tends to channel lube especially nicely. Which is a good thing:<br/>\n<br/>\nEnormous amounts of lube are a must with this insert. I cannot stress how much better it is if you literally fill it with lube from both endings, using your finger to make sure *all* the chambers are nicely filled with hot lube. Read on, and you\'ll find why.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Insertion and Intensity<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to class all inserts into three categories: Gentle, playful, and wild.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "Lotus Garden" is not merely wild. It is the very queen of the wild.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the first moment of insertion on, it will make perfectly clear who is in control here, and it\'s not you. As your sensitive tip presses against the first super-tight and thick lotus node, you\'ll groan. As that node squeezes over your glans, you\'ll understand that this amazon queen will not be denied. As that tightness shlups over the crown of your glans, you\'ll squeeze your eyes shut and curl your toes under in pleasure. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then already the next lotus node is kissing your very tip.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you go slowly - and it is an absolute must that you go slow, because it makes this insert so much better - the lotus nodes come in such quick succession, that the wet shlup-shlup-shlup on your glans will bring out your loud side. And in between each node, a pond of melting-hot, wet lube awaits, drooling your happy glans full of more slick, heated wetness to prepare it for the next kiss of the next lotus node. These reservoirs of hot lube make the "Lotus Garden" feel so hot, that it literally feels like your glans, your shaft, your entire length is going to melt into blissful heat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then you hilt inside it, perfectly positioned for a lotus node to clench shut behind your glans and for another to squeeze your glans tight. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then you pull back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where you get *loud*. In reverse, the lotus nodes don\'t simply shlup over the crown of your glans. The "Lotus Garden" doesn\'t seem reluctant to feel you go, like Miela\'s "Mini Lotus". It doesn\'t seem to invite you back inside like the "Love Humps". It hates to let go of even an inch of you - it chomps down and holds on to your glans as best it can, each node rippling over your crown so tightly that you\'ll feel it in your spine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Climax and Aftermath<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWant to last inside the "Lotus Garden"? Good luck, you\'re on your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it (sadly) doesn\'t quite make you cum during insertion as "the real thing" sometimes does, it does not give you much time. While gentler textures might beckon you to cum, might playfully invite you to cum, the "Lotus Garden" will have none of that. It demands your cum, and it wants it now, and it hates every second you waste on not cumming already.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you near orgasm - and you\'ll do so *very* quickly - the shlupping, glans-kissing, chomping, grabbing oven of the "Lotus Garden" will seem to tighten down almost unbearably. Each lotus node seems to snap angrily at your glans, threatening to clip it off clean if you don\'t hurry up and push all the way back in and cum.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin no time, you\'ll want nothing more than to give in, and you\'ll push deep, and stay there. Don\'t even think about moving inside it while cumming; the overstimulation will reliably ruin your orgasm if you do. Just stay deep, and enjoy - for orgasm inside the "Lotus Garden" will be short, screamy, and utterly draining. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time I enjoyed the well-heated, lube-drooling "Lotus Garden", I went "Oh god" upon insertion; but when I then came, I couldn\'t help bucking my hips up and into it like crazy, crying my girlfriend\'s name, my legs cramping, my penis and testicle aching with the intensity of each throb and each spurt.It felt like my pennis was trying to pull loose and like it was trying to ejaculate my testicles into the "Lotus Garden" at the same time. Afterwards, I was left giggling and muttering "oh holy fuck...oh holy fuck..." for a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the "Lotus Garden" is that intense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are thinking about going for a second round right after, forget it. You\'ll have a hard time pulling out, because you\'ll be left so sensitive, and the texture is so intense. I myself have to stay inside it limp for a minute or two before I can even pull it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerversely, however, once you\'ve recovered - and after orgasms in the "Lotus Garden", recovery tends to take longer than a young\'un like myself is used to - makes a second, and even a third session tempting. Even if you think you can last forever, or worry that you will have trouble reaching climax again so soon, fear not: The "Lotus Garden" will take care of it. It comes at a price though: Two or three sessions in close succession with it, and you\'ll feel all tender "down there" for the rest of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeware: Using not enough lube will result in you getting stuck. Not dangerous, but very uncomfortable if you have to pull outthrough all those tight lotus nodes with more force than you\'ll enjoy. Will leave you feeling raw. Use more lube!<br/>\n<br/>\nReview Disclaimer:<br/>\n<br/>\nContinental European, therefore uncut - and thus sensitive.<br/>\nHappily average (15cm/6in long; 15cm/6in around).<br/>\nPrefer to go slow, gentle, and very wet - the goal is to drink in all the sensations.<br/>\nAlways reviewing with the end cap off, nicely warmed, and with lots of lube.<br/>\nNot interested in realism.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>The most intense texture in the club.

Now onto the review!</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nLit was a very good sleeve that didn’t get much attention for reasons I’m not sure of. It’s looser than most anal sleeves, allowing the textures to be felt in their entirely, while still having enough tightness to it to provide a bit of that hugging sensation, especially with the anal entrance being one of the tightest I’ve felt and the choke point at about 3.5-4”. The beginning arrowed bump chamber provides really nice stimulation and are very rigid, adding some intensity to the mix as well. The choke point that follows is very pleasant on the glans providing awesome sensation when stroking back and forth between it. My head reaches the following square bumps and they feel as expected and really nice on the tip/head but if you’re 6” or longer, I would expect that this chamber would shine even more and the sleeve could be even better.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>A great anal sleeve, while not in the same category as some of the very best sleeves, definitely worth looking at sooner than later if you’re looking to build a collection.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"March 7th, 2021",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mccal100",reviewer:"Mccal100",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/RileySteele-Gallery1_grande.jpg?v=1617906945","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/RileySteele-Gallery2_grande.jpg?v=1617906945","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/RileySteele-Gallery3_grande.jpg?v=1617906945","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/RileySteele-Gallery4_grande.jpg?v=1617906945","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/RileySteele-Gallery5_grande.jpg?v=1617906945"]},{name:"Forbidden",girl:"Shared Texture",url:"/en/texture/forbidden",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/forbidden.jpg",scores:[3.04,3.48,3.76,4.17,3.64,3.71,2.26,3.96,3.65,3.39,3.33,3.98,3.71,3.76],description:"Forbidden is the most realistic anal intercourse experience in existence.

On a really good day it's 5.5 x 6.0, but age does that to you. :-)\nI'm skipping any mention of Noise, cleanup time and drying time. We have an air cleaner and fans running in the bedroom (white noise), so I would not notice any noise from the sleeve. I use the run water thru the sleeve method of cleaning and then set them on the bookshelf for drying.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nAfter getting Legend, I went looking for other open/loose sleeves that you do not need a full erection to enter. That led me to Caliente among other sleeves. The lips on the orifice like Legend help to guide you right into the sleeve. The lips are basically wide open and I can slide right in without needing a full erection.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was able to spend 2 hours today using this sleeve. It didn't matter if I was semi-flaccid or fully erect, I was still able to continue using the sleeve because of the open and loose texture of the sleeve. This is exactly the kind of sleeve that I was looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrifice: A nice open pair of lips that are firm enough that they help guide you into the sleeve. No noticeable tightness to the entry point, rather a nice smooth penetration of the entry point.<br/>\n<br/>\nTexture: I don't really notice the texture of this sleeve yet. Its more that I feel the walls, its that meaty hugging feeling that I like. When I get fully erect, the pressure of the walls is more noticeable and there seems to be something at about 3\" in that I feel that I am passing when I push all the way in. I do not see anything in the texture that I can say that is it, but I feel it when I'm using the sleeve.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuction: With the cap fully closed, there is some noticeable suction to this sleeve.<br/>\n<br/>\nTightness: I'd put Caliente in with the looser sleeves, which still means that there is some tightness to me due to girth. It's more of a pleasant hugging than a gripping tightness. I'd almost compare it to what I think of as an anal sleeve.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>For the older guy that does not have that rock solid erection, this is a good easy to enter sleeve. If your looking for a mellow sleeve to edge with for longer sessions, I'd say that Caliente fits that bill to a T.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 27th, 2019",reviewer_url:"/en/u/mike_in_co",reviewer:"Mike_in_CO",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Veronica-Gallery-4_grande.jpg?v=1500562218","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Veronica-Gallery-1_grande.jpg?v=1500562218","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Veronica-Gallery-2_grande.jpg?v=1500562218","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Veronica-Gallery-3_grande.jpg?v=1500562218","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Veronica-Gallery-5_grande.jpg?v=1500562218"]},{name:"Barracuda",girl:"Lisa Ann",url:"/en/texture/barracuda",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/barracuda.jpg",scores:[3.78,3.88,3.47,3.46,3.36,2.44,2.48,2.74,3.89,3.29,2.83,2.67,2.4,3.75],description:"The Barracuda texture is a gripping battery of unmatched pleasure.

It might not be my favorite or most effective sleeve, but it's possibly the most all-around appropriate or versatile. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. Lisa Ann is not the top pornstar I would choose to bang but I'm a huge fan of her anatomy as it appears on the mold. She has a very attractive pussy in my opinion and I like that about this product. 2. Some people describe the sleeve as tight. I don't think it's as tight as Destroya, Beyond, or Heavenly. I find this less intense. You can bang it out or edge with it. 3. I thought I'd be able to feel a huge difference between the bumps facing different directions. This is kind of hard to tell honestly. But I will say I'm glad the deeper ones face away as this is one of the main reasons I was interested in the product. I very much imagined that I would like the sensation of something that looked like this when pulling out. 4. Another reason I really like this sleeve is you can move a little bit and feel a difference rather than resort to longer strokes or movements. I feel like I can get deep in Lisa Ann and twist, or wiggle, or pull up and down very delicately and get a lot out of that. 5. The nubs wrap around your cock and make you feel really immersed inside and when you pull out it wants to keep you in. 6. It doesn't have too much tightness, over-variation, or over-stimulation. So, I like to get to the edge, go all the way in and use micro-movements and pull back just a little as I'm blowing my load.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>This sleeve definitely feels better than several of my ex-girlfriends even though it's cold and not a vagina attached to a person.

Your ticket to find out exactly what you want before you buy. It's time to review our next Fleshlight! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Jenna Jameson Legend Fleshlight is a vaginal sleeve with a combination of different textures found behind the perfect replica of Jenna’s famous pussy lips. Like the other sleeves in the Fleshlight Girls series it displays a copy of her signature next to the entrance.<br/>\n<br/>\nLegend has a lot of textures and can be roughly divided into seven sections over the nine inches of the sleeve. It looks interesting, to say the least!<br/>\n<br/>\nInside the entrance the canal starts with two wide cross ribs followed by a slight constriction and three wide elongated bumps which twist around the sides of the canal. Next come two offset rows of large bumps with pointed tips, before the canal opens out slightly into a short smooth-walled section.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt just over 3.5” (85mm) from the entrance the sleeve constricts again, continuing with a zig-zag rib and two smooth cross ribs which gradually tighten until the diameter reached 0.4” (10mm) at its tightest point (5.5”, or 140mm, from the entrance).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final section of the Legend consists of two parts. The first part of the chamber has a spiraling texture, with large pointed bumps for extra stimulation. Then, from 7.5” (10mm), the passage narrows again as round raised bumps press into the center of the sleeve.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Legend has a few tight sections, narrowing to a width of just 0.4” (10mm) in several places. This tightness is noticeable as soon as you enter the sleeve and push through the first wide ribs and the spiraling section that follows. It feels like the sleeve is winding itself around the head of your penis and drawing you in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bumps in the Legend are quite wide, but the pointed tips mean that they stimulate the sensitive head of the penis as you move through them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second constriction creates another section that you have to push through, with a lovely feeling of penetration before the sleeve widens again. The final part of the sleeve once again tickles the tip of the penis with small, pointed stimulations. I could not reach very far into this section but the feeling was very nice around the head on the penis.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite the highly textured appearance, the Legend was not as intense as I expected it to be; there was enough sensation to make it enjoyable but it remained comfortable even after orgasm. The feeling was also a lot more realistic and smoother than I expected, especially as lube started to build up and ‘smooth out’ the ridges.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Jenna Jameson is a star in the porn world, and her namesake sleeve definitely lived up to her reputation. I would rate the Legend as one of the best general Fleshlight sleeves I have tried. I think that it would work even better for longer guys who are able to fully enjoy the last section, but I was very satisfied and will definitely be coming back to this sleeve.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"October 3rd, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/stiffpoles",reviewer:"stiffpoles",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Bulletproof",girl:"Teagan Presley",url:"/en/texture/bulletproof",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/bulletproof.jpg",scores:[2.87,3.35,3.53,3.28,3.47,3.94,2.14,4.34,3.66,3.35,3.35,3.92,3.49,3.73],description:"Formerly known as Love Humps, inspired by Teagan's unstoppable ass, the Bulletproof texture was designed as a hybrid between the lotus garden and speed bump textures.

I have to say, I should purchase another since the lotus is looking a little worse for wear, and I lost the cap long ago. Seeing as I have the shower attachment cap, it’s never bothered my flight experiences; I would actually recommend using it since there is a vent in that cap and it creates the perfect amount of suction for me.

I will be reviewing the others as well so if you want to compare my opinions, check those out as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a buy-in of 4 regular sized sleeves back in 2009 I took a big break from male sex toys. The old sleeves were from the original line up and, after the novelty of bumping rubber wore off, they were pretty much all found lacking and put in a box in the closet, rarely seeing the light of day. Years later I saw that there was a line up of some interesting looking smaller sleeves that wouldn't break bank, so I dived back in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've seen a lot of people describe the Surge as one of the most intense sleeves around. It sure doesn't beat around the bush, sporting a snug canal cram packed full of texture. No inch of your manhood will be left unnoticed as tiny criss crossing strips covers almost the entire interior, only broken up at the midway in favor of a double-chamber with spikes. The sleeves biggest strength in my opinion is its suction effect when going full force on the end cap. Also, while I'm not a big fan of the standard pink color of the non-FL range, I really must credit the designers of this new vaginal orifice. I much prefer it to the standard version as there are subtle details to be found while still staying rather \"generic\" to cater to a broad audience. Clean up and dry time is improved over its full-sized siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntense it is, but I find that it might be too much stimulation, resulting in that \"numbing\" feeling i reckon some others describe when it comes to over-stimulation. This makes the sleeve oddly less intensive than other looser sleeves I've tried. This sleeve is also very unrealistic and one of the least smooth sleeves I own (pretty clear from just looking at the inside). It is limited how much variation can be had in a small sleeve but it's still on the mediocre side here.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Tight and highly intense, maybe even too intense. If you are prone to getting numb from high stimulation, beware of the Surge. Suction is one of its greatest feats as the small case allows for little air flow.

The wings were very different too, def attracted me to this at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nPenetration:<br/>\nThis was wide open. Invited you in. The mixture on this sleeve was weird though kind of stiff. The first row of STU was nice and made it feel tighter as it hugged the shaft nicely. The rest was basically a loose Destroya. That was the other thing that i liked about this. I figured it was just as good but looser with less suction. I was right. The ribs leading to the Tighter STU pocket would draggg across the head. This was an intense sleeve at the time. The STU pocket and Fangs were like head torture.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeansation:<br/>\nThis was kinda like Destroya, aggressive and would sneak up on you if you didn't respect it. I was less experienced and i used to cum fast alot with this. The dual STU sections were good and at different tightness. Created a lot of variety. The hybrid Destroya vibe was tough but nice since it was looser. This thing was like torture for your head. I never had a serious sensitivity issue but this thing alway got me. The STU and fangs always made me finish fast and almost always inside. Not DGS approved at all. This looked like a nice mold at the time this was the first of its kind. Being able to fill this thing and reach all the sensations at once was mind blowing. I would relate it to my Cream review just so much going on at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotes:<br/>\nThis was very cold and stiff sleeve. Didn't mold and hug the natural way most did at the time. This could still be considered the end of gen 1 FLG do it was just a different time. I think they experiment with the pigment or something on this one. The wings were rough not fun for early arousal play. That was a let down. I didnt use it much, mostly when I just wanted to cum fast or to finish off on a multi sleeve session. May have never really broke it in. The stiffness of this sleeve kind of pointed me in the direction of the Darker pigmented sleeves. One of my only regrets purchase wise. Always had a hard time cleaning and drying too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrgasm:<br/>\nIntense and fast. I always finished fast at the time. I didn't care but it was kind of more business than pleasure. <br/>\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>She was hot this wasn't. The orgasm was hard but always left me wanting more with my head just pulsating and kind of aching. The enjoyment of the STU sections later led me to buy that next. Kind of a forgotten sleeve to say the least I think they had it on the make your own for awhile. The only demo for this was larger guys who needed an over stimulating experience.

Equipped with a degree in psychology and the hands-on experience she got by lending significant effort to the growth of the social marketing empire, Lena the Plug (LTP) recognized the tremendous opportunity there was for young women to build personal brands and monetize them — she knew she was more than capable of doing this for herself. Knowing that her butt was often a topic of conversation, Lena started vlogging about fitness, with an emphasis on working out her booty - in skimpy apparel.\n\n\nFast forward a few years and Lena the Plug is a famous vlogger and social media influencer - especially among millennial and GenZ fans. With a knack for toeing the line with her raunchy and sexually charged (yet SFW) YouTube content, before she knew it, she had over 1 million YouTube subscribers and over 1 million Instagram followers. Couple that with her enormous premium Snapchat subscriber roster, Lena the Plug is undoubtedly the perfect choice to debut Fleshlight’s newest era of fantasy strokers. \n\n\nWhile she was a fixture at the Vixen, Tushy, Blacked Booth at this years AVN Awards, Lena the Plug isn’t your quintessential porn performer. Primarily known for her home videos featuring her with other beautiful women, threesomes, or intimate moments with her equally social media-famous boyfriend, it's hard to define the power that LTP wields. A controversial influencer, she keeps it raw and real and embraces a very open and candid sex life. She beat out Kim Kardashian at the inaugural Pornhub Awards for Celebrity of the Year - and if that doesn’t pique your interest in exploring her Honey or Perfect Fleshlight, then we aren’t quite sure what will.

I recommend this one on feeling, but for cleanup and lube consumption it is a poor choice. The nodules in all the chambers feel awesome, but to some degree it is boring and despite appearing to feel variable, it isnt much variation but the conical form and the grooving works very well. The first part that goes tighter to looser is fantastic but the non textured ring can be disappointing.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>This is one to enjoy, but before this I would recommend "boss level" before this, but I feel that butt textures are too overlooked on the stigma of negative perception of anal in straight men </p>\n</div>',review_time:"November 28th, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/comicalrock",reviewer:"ComicalRock",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:["http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery1_bf779c20-9910-4b98-aba2-95d4fdad9825_grande.jpg?v=1620229727","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery2_f14d5383-586c-423d-9458-8bac0539e04d_grande.jpg?v=1620229727","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery3_8edac438-fa4b-4472-b0a9-d922b6818a1d_grande.jpg?v=1620229727","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery4_57a905bf-6f8d-4745-9f46-1a63410c719a_grande.jpg?v=1620229727","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery5_5c815224-b70d-4e02-8661-bb6d389e9b5a_grande.jpg?v=1620229727","http://www.fleshlight.eu/cdn/shop/products/Gallery6_803d3075-a3ff-4dbe-9521-16dfc28ee6d7_grande.jpg?v=1620229727"]},{name:"Torque",girl:"",url:"/en/texture/torque",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/torque.jpg",scores:[3.36,3.41,3.19,3.84,3.48,2.1,3.47,2.79,3.55,3.22,3.21,3.22,2.9,3.57],description:"First ICE Texture for the Fleshlight GO.",review:'<div class="text">\n<p>\nGood Sleeve. <br/>\nOriginally went with the torque due to recommendations about it in reference to my size and can say it has been good.

Anatomically, this is spot on, its a great visual stimulant to see the wings split as you enter, and firmly grip as you enjoy the sleeve. as you enter, a series of ridges greets you with a gripping sensation on your head. As you push through, the nubs take you gently into their possession and massage your head and shaft as you continue to the "galena and pyrite" section. This section is especially unlike any other sleeve ive felt. the entirety of the sleeve is sucking you the entire time and its lube use is moderate. fully closing the cap on the case, creates an intense sucking feature where it wont fall off, meaning the suction of this sleeve is top notch. Continue using the sleeve at its fullest provides a variable sensation, which you can glide through slowly to feel it all amongst yourself.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>this sleeve is one of my favorites of my collection and will continue to see use, and like wine, get better with time. easy to clean up, isnt too loud and its lube use is moderate.

But I got this for an absolute killer price off amazon recently, and I couldn't resist! I'm particularly happy I didn't!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I wrote I'm into very intense sensations, and I kind of expected this one to be a failure. But it surprised me a lot! It is not what't I'd call intense, but the subtle stimulation of the corona is so overly pleasurable, that I used this pretty often. Over time the subtle stimulation even allowed me to regain some sensitivity on my penis. This makes not only this sleeve more pleasurable, but also all other high intensity sleeves more intense! Even normal sex has gotten better that way! Oh, I love that!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe canal is wider than many other sleeves, what usually felt good to me, like the BiHive or the Legend. The spiraling structure stimulates my favourite spots on the corona of the tip. I guess that is why I like this sleeve despite its low intensity...<br/>\n<br/>\nLube use:<br/>\nThis sleeve feels best to me with smaller amounts of thin watery lube. I wet the insite and apply a drop of normal lube. It'll mix...<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't care for the loudness, the cleaning and drying properties as they are the least important of all. I only mention them if they stand out, which they do in this case. It's silent, comparably easy to clean and dries faster than higher structured sleeves do.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor cleaning I use mild hand washing soap (\"soap free soap\"), which does not hurt the sleeves noticably, even the frequently used ones! I don't trust only using water with all the structures in this sleeve! I also use talkum and NOT corn starch. Moist corn starch is a perfect nutrient for molds and bacteria of any kind, so using corn starch with a slight drying error (which you almost can't avoid) is the fastest way for your sleeve to the garbage!\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>If you are into subtle but very pleasurable sensations, foremost on the corona: Try it!

Nipple Alley is based on the wildly popular speed bump texture with the added sensation of tiny nipple-like dots on the top of the bumps. This added level of stimulation tickles you all the way up and down for an extra level of sensation.",review:'<div class="text">\n<p>\nWhen you look at the Nipple Alley, you think of a delicate massage with a happy ending. This texture has a series of pillows resembling miniature breasts with their corresponding nipples. First impressions with this sleeve were on the "It\'s going to be a soft and easy ride" Boy, was I mistaken...<br/>\n<br/>\nNipple Alley (Nipple from now on), is more intense than it looks originally. Its tight entrance and a texture that is present early on the sleeve gives immediate feedback. It feels tighter than expected, and the little breasts rub your penis at all moments. The feedback is similar to the STU\'s, but because the pillows are rounder and slightly smaller, the sensation is softer and more enjoyable. It is one of those textures that allows full control of the session, giving you the option of hitting it at full speed or going slowly at it. The nipples on top of each rounded pillow don\'t make their presence felt until you are getting close to the orgasm - then they "bite" on your penis, lightly scrapping it making you twist and shout during orgasm. I could continue fucking the Nipple during orgasm - something that drove me into overdrive a few times and made me having seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Nipple feels tighter than expected, tugging your penis with the right pressure. As with many FLs, the Nipple texture feels sharper as you release pressure by releasing or removing the end cap. With the end cap completely removed, I could feel the whole texture with those nipples massaging my entire penis. It feels as good and intense with the end cap completely tightened - this time with the rounded pillows doing the job of driving me crazy with the tightness. Perfect tightness anyway I tried it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe texture is not designed to replicate any real type of intercourse, but with the end cap completely tightened, it felt close to nice, fat pussy. Maybe it was how horny I was during that session, but it felt like that...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs most Fleshlights, just place it under the faucet and flush between 30 and 60 seconds on both ends with running water.

I don\'t give a crap about the model, but the texture had me interested since I saw it - a series of cones divided by wide rings of material. Just looking at it, the Marvel seems to be the lovechild of the Love Humps and the 69 Caliber because of the wide rings and the spacious chambers. The texture promised to be a low to medium intensity sleeve because of the wide chambers and the lack of nubs or other high-intensity parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the Marvel really surprised me. The entrance was tighter than I expected and the rings were much more noticeable than in the Love Humps. Still, the Marvel is one of those sleeves on the mid stimulation level similar to the Torrid and the Bookwoorm - it is not too aggressive, but keeps you interested at all times, allowing to build up a massive orgasm.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a stroker, the rings felt tight around my penis while the chambers allowed my penis head to expand and get ready for the next pressing ring. The sensations were like the ones from a slightly aggressive handjob (if I am going to compare them with anything). Using it with my Meiki Plush Doll (a.k.a "Lisi" in honor of a crush I had as a teenager), the Marvel became one of those Fleshlights perfect for edging and taking my sweet time during the lazy weekend mornings. I enjoyed hitting that ass, building a fat load until I could not hold any more. Orgasms were intense, both during the building process and during the ejaculation.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleaning the Marvel is as easy as cleaning other Fleshlights, needing only for you to flush the sleeve under running water. It dries pretty quick, ready to be stored after just 6 hours.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>The Marvel is another good signature texture from the guys at Fleshlight / Fleshjack. It is a medium intensity toy perfect for edging or just to have long sessions.

It's about .75\" in diameter and the only defining features are the ribs which are fairly stimulating and the row of bumps that run along one side of the texture. The bumps are definitely one of my favorite parts of the sleeve. When using the sleeve, it definitely feels more like an older woman, as it's looser than the other FL Girls and not as intense allowing you to last longer. However, if you twist the sleeve so the row of bumps are below your penis, it takes it to a whole other level.

With a two week family vacation coming up, I thought that a Quickshot might be a good toy to bring along for some discrete fun. Mia's Compact Lvl Up looked like it could provide a pleasurable experience in a convenient package.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't end up taking this toy on vacation (we'll get into that later), but I have used it approximately 12 times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's break it down section by section:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEntrance/Exit:<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that sold me on this particular Quickshot was the dual entrances.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe vagina side is surprisingly wide. For such a small toy, I was not expecting the entrance to be this loose. I actually quite like this feature, as it can be nice to tease myself a bit before I'm fully ready to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe anal side, as expected, is significantly tighter. There's nothing really unique or remarkable about this entrance, but it's fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I listed \"exits\" here is because the sleeve is so short and open ended, anyone over 4.5\" will pop out the other side. At 5.5\", this means I have about an inch (a bit more if I really compress the sleeve) of excess to work with. For me, this means that there's a quick pop through with each full stroke. On the vaginal side, a pop through is almost like a set of lips kissing the head of my penis. It's the best part of the sleeve IMO. On the anal side, the experience is similar, but it's just a straight expansion/contraction of a ring vs the wrapping of lips. Both feel good, but exiting the vaginal side is the clear winner in my book.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: Because of the open ended design, this toy can be loud AF! Easily, it's the loudest of my entire collection. As I pop through the \"exit,\" the toy makes an audible GAWK sound, like a sloppy, sloppy blowjob. I suspect for longer/shorter folks, this won't be as much of an issue, but OMG, it sounds like someone is trying to suck my soul out of my penis lol! One one hand, it's kind of hot. On the other hand, I absolutely was not going to take this on vacation. Stealth just wasn't happening with this sleeve (for me), and I didn't want to have an awkward family conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nADDITIONAL NOTE: This sleeve is TIGHT! At 5\"girth, it is borderline uncomfortably tight. I have used the sleeve outside of the case, which helps, but girthier gents best stay away. I find that I need to be extra diligent about lube use and keeping sessions shorter to avoid soreness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, I don't feel as though I get the full benefit of this sleeve at 5.5\". I'm long enough that I have an inch of excess, but short enough that the excess isn't enough to take advantage of.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome folks mention connecting two sleeves together and using the Quickshot that way, but I didn't get much from that experience. I don't have a second Quickshot, but I think I'd have the same issues. Realistically, I can only hit the first .5\" of a second sleeve. The cleanup isn't worth the minimal improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers mention having a partner perform oral on the excess. I love that idea, but I didn't have a willing partner. I tried to simulate the experience using a La Bocca Della Verita Onahole. This was definitely better than using a second Fleshlight, but I'm still not sure it was worth the cleanup. That toy is obnoxious to clean and dry!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n0\" - 2.5\" From the Vaginal Side:<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not own Mia's full-size Lvl Up, but this bit is meant to be a scaled down version of the infamous tentacle texture. While similar, it lacks the suction cup portions. Consequently, it's kind of just a bumpy spiral. It LOOKS like it should be pretty intense, but I actually found it to be mild. Despite the overall tightness of this toy, this section feels a bit loose to me. I think perhaps there is too much texture here? Rather than feeling the bumps, it's kind of a smooth sensation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2.5\" - 4\" From the Vaginal Side:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bumps in this section are far rounder than I was anticipating. The texture view doesn't provide the most accurate representation of this, but think of the bumps in STU. From the pictures, I was expecting something more angular. The sensation here is an amped up version of the previous section. Entering from the vaginal side means more stimulation on the head, while entering from the anal side means more stimulation on the shaft. Depending on what I'm going for, I find myself alternating entrances. If I HAD to choose, I'd say that entering anal and exiting with the vaginal lips kissing my head is the better sensation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBONUS:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sleeve works well with The Handy.

The hole is too small!\" I knew that inside, I would encounter a mini ribbed entrance followed by a smooth, wavy canal joined with the almost vacuum suction of the SIACs. I expected great sessions with this petite ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike its full version, the mini Forbidden gives you immediate feedback upon penetration thanks to the micro ribs, which feel sharper in the mini. Because the wavy canal is way tigher than in the full size Forbidden, you really feel the waves when you are pumping into the SIAC. The material hugs your penis at all times, giving you pleasure in every movement. Add the vacuum typical of the SIACs, and you have a ball drainer toy. Give or take, after 30 minutes I was filling the little asshole with fresh cream after explosive orgasms at the end of each of the evaluation sessions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, if you want it tight, the SIACs give you tight. The O'Doyle grips your cock and milk it - even with the end cap completely removed. Place the end cap and you have almost the perfect cock vacuum. I say \"almost\" because surprisingly, the O'Doyle allows for movement when the end cap is fully tightened, so it's possible to enjoy maximum vacuum. Just be sure to keep your cock inside, since you will need to lessen the cap to be able to get back in.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that SIACs tend to be slightly difficult to deal with hands free. They sometimes cave in, exposing the hard plastic rim which can be dangerous to your genitalia. With the O'Doyle I didn't have that problem. I hit this little ass with everything I got and it held valiantly. Both hand stroking and hands free sessions were great, with the hands free sessions being more intense (and shorter).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only complain with the O'Doyle is that this fucker kept kicking me out. During each session, I constantly felt the sleeve pushing my dick out, popping it out often while I was deep fucking it. Just like a girl that is complaining about how anal sex hurts, the O'Doyle kept pushing me back, forcing me to change position regularly and re-lubing my cock regularly for easier reentry. Great for an anal rape fantasy, but annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs most Fleshlights, just place it under the faucet and flush between 30 and 60 seconds on both ends with running water. Not too difficult to clean.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>The O'Doyle is a must have toy for any man looking for a ball draining experience. If you have regular fantasies with petites, or having anal sex with young, inexperienced barely legal girls (or boys), then this is your toy.

Typically used in shower with the shower mount after having heated up the sleeve and the lube.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><br/>\nThe Blade fleshlight is one that has been in my collection for quite some time now, but unfortunately doesn’t see much use. However the texture is actually really good, it is both moderately stimulating and intense, which makes this a good sleeve for edging sessions, as it can quickly bring you to the tipping point of orgasm and then it’s up to you how long you can try and hold it back. Once you’ve decided to cum the actual orgasm can be very intense. When breaking this sleeve in I found the texture to be kind of firm as to almost be uncomfortable, but pushed through it using it a few times and it softened out to be a really pleasurable experience. It has a deep rib pattern throughout with varying diameters which is another really nice feature of the texture. For me though I prefer hands free use which is the only reason my Blade is not used more frequently, because I have not been able to find an effective way to use it hands free. The downside to the Blade is the case, I found the ‘squeeze’ ability of the case to be kind of gimmicky, as I always thought the whole point of the fleshlights were to not use your hands for stimulation anyway. During use the Blade case is probably the loudest out of all the fleshlights I have by far due to the little vent holes in the back, but probably could be modified in a way to quite in up a bit. It is also a bit of a pain to put the sleeve back in the case after cleaning, and the deep ribbing of the inner texture collects plenty of water which makes drying of the sleeve take a fairly long time.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>To sum it up the sleeve and texture are actually amazing and probably one of my favourite textures but the case is a little disappointing, considering what is was designed for and also that it is difficult to use hands free. If you don’t mind having a hand on it all the time and not fussed by noise, then give the Blade a go.</p>\n</div>',review_time:"December 5th, 2020",reviewer_url:"/en/u/flair",reviewer:"FLair",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"The Fang",girl:"Succu Dry/Count Cockula",url:"/en/texture/the-fang",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/the-fang.jpg",scores:[3.61,3.49,3.29,3.77,3.88,1.53,2.1,2.06,3.21,2.41,2.42,2.83,2.78,3.18],description:"Introducing Succu Dry Sex in a Can from Fleshlight, the world's first vampire inspired sex toy for men.

In my opinion, it even has some advantages over the full size. The “teeth” are not as dense and I could feel each individual one sliding on my tip. Whereas in the full size, it’s more overstimulating all around. Of course, the biggest downside to any quickshot is the inability to go balls deep which is a big part of the enjoyment to me. Also penetrating through the other side usually pulls on my frenulum in a way that I’m not sure if I enjoy or hate. A little in between. The lube usage and cleanup is so efficient though, its great for lazy sessions. Hell, sometimes I just spit in it because the sleeve is so small. My personal favorite aspect though is that you can really thrust in and out of this thing with ease. Even if my entire member wasn’t being stimulated, I just really enjoy the motion of thrusting. It’s great for edging.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>A great, lube efficient sleeve that you can use in a lot of different ways.

While the quickshot turbo provides the benefits of the turbo design and orifice which provides different entry variations and multiple penetration points, both ends of the double ended quickshot design share the same orifice unlike the pussy/butt or butt/mouth quickshots. This gives less options for entry and exit penetration sensations. As always, the quick shots are tighter and more compact (be aware those who are well endowed above average size. This compactness however does make the quickshots easier to clean. I have found however that this particular quickshot uses more lube than usual. Nothing that ruins the flight sessions however, as like other quickshots, the customisability of it compact design allows for more creative flying sessions. Add the turbo quickshot to the base of your shaft to give yourself a blowjob sensation while stroking off the rest of the shaft with another fleshlight of choice.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Good on its own and as an accessory to enhance flying with other flights. The quickshot turbo is a nice add to any collection. Especially those which enjoy the quickshot line and are adventurous.

The price point really is good. I got my Quickshot STU for $35, whereas most FLG (Fleshlight Girls) models are $70. It served as a great low-risk introduction to Fleshlights.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. While portability wasn't a concern for me, it is actually quite nice to own something that I could take on a trip relatively inconspicuously. It's small enough to fit in a large coat pocket, or to stuff in a corner of a backpack or luggage bag and cover with clothes and won't be found unless someone is really digging through your shit. That said, the gold case would be an immediate \"what's that?\" if seen. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. As I said I was very concerned about cleaning and drying. I'm happy to say that cleaning and drying Fleshlights is much easier than I was fearing, so that's good. Since I have gotten some FLG models though, I now know that the STU is actually more work to clean and dry than many full size models! That said, again, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. One thing to consider is that since the STU is double-ended, when I came it wasn't contained in the sleeve, so there was potential of getting cum everywhere. Again, the full size sleeves are actually easier to use, clean, and cum in without worrying about getting it everywhere. But if you're a bit careful, you should be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. In terms of my experience, this thing blew me away. Like, temporarily losing control of my body as I cum everywhere. But I have to assume a big part of that was because it was my first Fleshlight, and even just a Fleshlight in general as opposed to using my hand. Even now after trying other models, it's not bad. That said, I've found that I very much prefer the look of the FLG pussies as opposed to the generic \"pink lady\" that the STU has. I also really prefer cumming inside a sleeve and not having to worry about catching my cum or anything like that.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>The Quickshot STU was a suitable introduction to Fleshlights at a \"low risk\" price point, and I'm glad I have it because of it's portability in case I go on a trip or something. I definitely don't regret buying it. That said, in terms of experience using it, it's mostly inferior to FLG products. It sees basically no use at home since I've gotten other more appealing options.</p>\n</div>",review_time:"December 15th, 2022",reviewer_url:"/en/u/droflight",reviewer:"droflight",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Drac",girl:"Blood Lust",url:"/en/texture/drac",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/drac.jpg",scores:[2.59,2.93,3.09,2.63,3.08,2.2,2.23,3.03,2.66,3.3,3.13,3.6,3.7,2.92],description:"Take a flight on the dark side and have a fling in the wings.

We have been able to get head from a vampire for some time now with Succu Dry and Count Cockula, but now we can finally get a piece of vampire snatch! The texture looks like some mating of Dragon and Twista with the large spiraling ridge and the conical bumps in between. I do not like Dragon, but I do love Twista. Thankfully, it is better than Dragon and I prefer it to Twista. A surprising outcome since a lot of the best textures put together do not always produce a superior sleeve or even an equal sometimes. Drac produces a bizarre feeling as you use it that I don’t think I have encountered before and I like it! The FLight itself is very good but the orgasm is more powerful than you would expect. I think it has something to do with those pointy cones complementing the large spiral ridge. I say this because if I try hard and focus on what my head is telling me I can feel those cones adding some serious pleasure to the mix. However, FLy hard and fast and they go unnoticed by your conscious, however, your unconscious and your dick know they are there; hence, the more powerful orgasm. I used this texture three times today and every time it commanded a strong orgasm. Also, an interesting note is that I can continue to stroke at almost full tilt while I am ejaculating, which makes this the most intense sleeve that I have been able to do that with.

Quickshots *ONLY* fit large girth when out-of-case, and lack the deep, immersive feel of a full sleeve, but they’re a fun and very different mellow toy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSleeves work completely differently depending on girth, so these reviews are here to help average-length girthy guys find the textures that fit best. Those with sensitive members may also find this info helpful, as the effect is similar even if not 100% comparable. Whether due to girth or sensitivity, you don’t want textures that scrape badly. <br/>\n<br/>\nInfo for reference: just under 6” length, 7” shaft girth with a 5.5” head that’s fairly sensitive.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmoothness: 10/10. There’s nothing in the texture to scrape, and when out of its case, it has tons of room to stretch (unless you *want* it tight in your hand). Very gentle, and even if the head of your manhood needs extra care, you can just stroke the QS lower on your shaft. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity: 3/10. Unless you grip it hard, it’s super mellow, though that’s far from a bad thing. Good for longer sessions, as you have huge control over how much you feel. This is best as a “patiently coax a huge orgasm out” toy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSensation: 10/10. Feels super similar to the Boost, though a little gentler/swirlier, and with textures that are more clear. You feel the series of bumps quite distinctly when they move over your head, but unlike the boost, it doesn’t get super loud as it slides over. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding either Quickshot, if you like smoother, gentle, teasing sensations, it’s pretty great. It glides across your shaft, and the angle, tightness, depth, and even how much it hits your head is all up to you. It’s not intense, and ironically won’t force you to shoot quickly, but makes for a lovely mellow time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity During Orgasm: N/A, as it can be anything you want. Hold tightly and work it hard for roughness, or keep it loose and lower for gentleness. If you’re sensitive while finishing, this is an ideal toy – not only is the material and structure (outside the case) super squishy and soft, but if your head gets too sensitive, you can move it only on your shaft during orgasm for no overstimulation.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Overall Experience: 10/10. It may not be good for a long thrusting session, but it’s ideal to use by hand (whether yours or a partner’s). Compact, discrete, travel-friendly, low lube use, and gives lots of control… though a touch messy out-of-case. Lacks the suction &amp; “deep“ feeling of full sleeves, but that said, a slow buildup culminating in seeing yourself blast a foot in the air is loads of fun. </p>\n</div>',review_time:"December 25th, 2017",reviewer_url:"/en/u/girthreviews",reviewer:"girthreviews",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Sword",girl:"",url:"/en/texture/sword",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/sword.jpg",scores:[3.21,3.1,3.44,3.52,2.83,2.13,2.84,2.45,2.63,2.76,2.37,2.47,2.47,2.9],description:"Sword by Fleshjack is still made with Fleshlight's patented SuperSkin material but the internal masturbation sleeve is enclosed in a soft case.

This is a very smooth and very mild sleeve. It's so mild you can't make up the sensations you're feeling when stroking. I imagine it feels only slightly more than stimulating than the Original Pink Lady. The opening vortex tunnel only adds the slightest of suction. I would recommend this for edging as most people can probably last quite a bit in it. The main attraction here is the clear sleeve as you can watch yourself pumping in and out and filling it with cum. It's a fun novelty at first that can get tired quickly. Due to the transparent material, it's extra sticky and cant be starched lest you ruin the transparency. The orgasms that accompany this sleeve are fine but 9 times out of 10 I would rather go with a different sleeve. I only use this one if I feel like looking at myself masturbating or get tired of my other ones.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>It's nothing special.

Much gentler with girth mod mentioned below. <br/>\n<br/>\nSleeves work completely differently depending on girth, so these reviews are here to help average-length girthy guys find the textures that fit best. Those with sensitive members may also find this info helpful, as the effect is similar even if not 100% comparable. Whether due to girth or sensitivity, you don’t want textures that scrape badly. <br/>\n<br/>\nInfo for reference: just under 6” length, 7” shaft girth with a 5.5” head that’s fairly sensitive; all sessions done with sleeve flaps cut off (for looseness) + Fleshlight warmed &amp; locked down horizontally to thrust into (for better feeling sensations). If you’re girthy, but not 7” girthy, awesome – way more sleeves will work for you! Average these reviews with others, according to where on the girth spectrum you fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: if a sleeve works poorly for your girth due to the case allowing no more room to stretch, cutting a layer off the sleeve’s ring (that sits behind the case’s ring) can work wonders to reduce pressure and let you feel everything better. Just be careful of the sleeve falling out if used vertically, and always test out small adjustments before modding a sleeve any amount. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeeds girth mod: Maybe. I can use it without, but the pressure definitely makes the ridges extra harsh. <br/>\n<br/>\nSmoothness: 4/10. At higher girth, it rubs quite a lot, and can leave you a bit raw from the ridges. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity &amp; Sensation: 7/10. How much you’re stretching it drastically changes the texture. The more it clings to your girth, the more the little ridges rub. It’s a very uniform sleeve, but can feel surprisingly intense despite how little texture there is. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntensity During Orgasm: 9/10. Not advisable if you’re sensitive during orgasm. The walls of the sleeve may not stick out far, but the edges can grind a lot, especially as you swell up while finishing.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>Overall Experience: 6/10. Same as with the similar sleeve Delight, it’s a unique and wide sleeve that’s good for girth, but may need a modification if you’re thick enough. It’s a bit rough and non-squishy for my tastes, but that’s just due to personal preference and sensitivity. Still feels good, but I’m not over the moon about it. </p>\n</div>',review_time:"December 14th, 2017",reviewer_url:"/en/u/girthreviews",reviewer:"girthreviews",length:22.5,min_diameter:10,max_diameter:20,gallery:[]},{name:"Boost",girl:"",url:"/en/texture/boost",image_url:"https://cdn.fleshassist.com/textures/upscaled/boost.jpg",scores:[2.49,2.47,2.24,2.78,.93,1.36,1.71,2.73,2.76,2.53,3.36,4.37,4.4,2.68],description:"",review:"<div class=\"text\">\n<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br/>I've got a 7 inch long and a 6.5 inches of girth.

I hoped for pretty intense stimulations but I got disappointed. I can feel the tightness and the point at which the canal gets tighter some centimeters in has its merits, but it generally cannot compete with other sleeves for me. It works okay in the first FLight after some days without sex of any kind and the fantasy of anal sex can kick in the head to support the feeling. But it does absolutely not create any overwhelming sensations that make some intense textures so addictive to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is somewhat realistic to anal sex that also feels tight but very smooth. But as it is more the thing in your head that rocks anal sex than the actual feeling that is hard to simulate, it won't come close to the real thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't rate the loudness as all sleeves are very quiet to my ears. The difference is irrelevant to me. That sleeve is easy to clean but dries only average. I have stored that sleeve in the cellar for whatever use there might be...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor cleaning I use mild hand washing soap (\"soap free soap\"), which does not hurt the sleeves noticably, even the frequently used ones! I also use talkum and NOT corn starch. Moist corn starch is a perfect nutrient for molds and bacteria of any kind.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>I don't recommend that sleeve to a circumcised man.
